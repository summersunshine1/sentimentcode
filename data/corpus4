I bought 2 of these for my twin 11 year old daughters.  They took pictures all over the place!  The photos are small, but the girls expected that.  No disappointment with this version of an old Polaroid.
love
Such an awesome little camera! Great for scrapbooks and tiny memories!
love it <3 <3
liked it
Love the camera - especially the cute light yellow color. The Pictures are a little small but turn out nicely. I brought this to a party and it was a hit! The size is perfect - fits well in a medium size handbag so very portable. Ended up buying a different color as a gift and they loved it. Would recommend if interested in buying a Polaroid camera 😄
I bought my camera and on the beggining it works very weel. When it arrives I had a lot of fun with my friends, and the pictures was awesome. But, after 1 month I started to see that the quality was not the same, I thought that was the light in that day. 2 weeks later I traveled, and when we took the first picture, the photograph did not leaves the camera. We took again and it leaves, but with some white stains. Now, it happens all the time and I am not using anymore. I did not recommend, was the worst disappointment I ever had with something that I bought.And I could not return, because was more the 1 month, and the seller do not have a contact.
Absolutely love it ! Came in perfect condition and was worth every penny.
Such a good camera! I love how you can change the lighting and the prints are just the right size. I love my camera soooo much!!!!
Ok, it's a total splurge buy, but totally worth it!  We love it. The teens love it. Everyone at the restaurants we go to and take family pics love it!  Super cute camera. It takes several practice shots to figure out the exposure/flash options. But overall, you get the same 'easily out of focus', 'over exposed' Polaroid pictures we all grew up with!! LOVE!! It was really fun watching my 13 yo take a picture, see it "pop out" and then develop infrintbif her. Worth every penny!!
I love it it's so cute!
Picture in seconds and it gives it that retro old look. Love it and def worth the price. Its much cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else. Great buy!
My daughter loves this camera. She takes a picture of everyone that comes over. Easy to operate and takes nice little pictures.
My order came in before the expected date:D I'm obsessed with my camera will buy again I highly recommend it! The color is a bit darker but still cute!
I love taking this traveling. When I come across children in small villages or remote areas, they love to get their photos taken and it is a great alternative to giving them candy. It has been with me to the Mongolian Steppe, Romanian Orphanages, Peruvian mountains...
Love this camera!!  The pictures turn out nicely and the camera is easy to use.  I gave this to my daughter for her 6th birthday and she loved it.  She used it at her party and all her friends now want one too.  It takes nice pictures and the film with the decorated borders on it is really fun.
I adore this camera, the picture style reminds of me of the old school polaroids and they're so much more meaningful since they are an actual physical photo instead of a digital one. The one tip is to try to shoot pictures in decent lighting and not too far away from your subject, because the picture can come out too dark even if you have the camera on the right setting.
It's amazing and just how it should be. I love it!!
Great camera! Takes good pictures and if super fun and easy to use!
Love this!! The pictures obviously are regular sized Polaroids but for $60 bucks the mini is so worth it!!
This camera is the cutest and most fun in photography I've ever had.
It was purchased as a gift and was exactly want was wanted. Great surprise.
She loves it
happy with the camera
Bought in 2015, worked great for my wedding guest book, would buy again.
Oh my God! I am in love with this camera. I got a clear cover for it just to be super careful with my little love. But honestly, if you're looking for a professionally photographed picture then it's definitely a no-no. But for all those vintage things obsessed people you have come to the right place, don't think twice before ordering it. Just need to be careful while taking pictures, as I have previously mentioned don't expect super perfect and clear pictures, but it's best while creating those special memories in picture instantly. You have a memory of your best time, without fearing to have lost it due to accidentally deleting your pictures on your phone, or in worst case scenarios if your phone gets lost. Sometimes, few memories are a lot worth then few dollars and for such time your Fujifilm Instax mini 8 is perfect.It's Fujifilm, it's a reputed and well-known brand so definitely there's no chance anything going wrong with the camera. Just keep the obvious things in your mind don't drop it in the water, don't drop it, and don't cover the flash while taking pictures.PS. Your friends are gonna be so jelly ;)
Love love love!
Nice color, and great camera.  Bought the twin pack film to accompany a terrific gift!
just GREAT!!!Camera works perfectly and simply love it.
Looks good, and works great!
My kids loved it! A lot of fun.
It broke within a few uses. Totally doesn't work at all. A waste of money. My 14 yo birthday present.
Great camera
a gift for grand kids they went nuts with thus camera. love it
Bought this for my daughter's graduation party and it worked great!Perfect little size and they like that the pics spit out right away and they can watch them appear.Great for a party.
It works fine, I don't have any problems with it, and I've had it for about 2 months now.
It's a fun camera
A fun camera. Made very well great gift.
Easy to use
Wonderful and receive in a timely manner.
<3 thank you
Just perfect
Love this camera. The photos are so fun, and it's great to have at parties. I only rated it 4 stars and not 5 because I wish the film was more affordable.
Good one, if it had gift wrap option it would be perfect
Great for fun. Really easy use and super cute!
Got it for my daughter.  She loves it and it works great.
Love it!
Niece loved it!
Easy to use and takes good pictures for a polarized camera and gives a nice retro feel
Great gift for tween
I am not a professional photographer, just an ordinary person that loves playing with the camera. You need to learn to use the different options like outside, inside, etc and then the pics look great.
Boyfriend loved it!!!!
It's awesome
Light, compact instant photos that are good quality.
Llooooove it
What a great gift for anyone! There is nothing better then a Polaroid!
The camera appeared to be in good condition at first, but when I tried taking a picture, the flash didn't work and they came out blank.
I got the grape color and love it! It's a dark purple and looks great with pretty much anything. Love the vintage look of the prints! Before I left a 1 star review for the raspberry color because it was tremendously ugly, instead of red it was a faded, old looking orange. This one that I have now works and looks amazing!The good: The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 is a cute, easy to use compact device. It can easily fit into a handbag and isn’t cumbersome to hold but I got one of the cute and convenient cases (that did not come with the device) that has a strap for around the body to protect my baby girl. The camera didn't come with a selfie mirror so I highly recommend getting one, if you're thinking of taking selfies with it (they're fairly inexpensive) just so you know where to position yourself. The operations are minimal, since the device is almost fully automatic, if and when you rotate the dial the light doesn't move that is why, it determines the best setting for the amount of light that surrounds the subject. It uses double A batteries (which came with the device) that are easy to find! Instant gratification!The bad: It holds only 10 film sheets at a time. The film it's expensive. Have to get batteries for the device when they run out. Sometimes the pictures aren't as clear as you want them to be. Didn't come with clear instructions, had to look for them on the Internet. The box it comes in seemed old and faded.Overall I love my little camera so I say get it! You won't regret it!
Not much quality for price!
Not sure why these are so popular with the 11-14 yo gang.... Especially the girls, but when did adults ever understand kids.
Have a blast every time I use this camera. Who doesnt love polaroids
The color is more like a red orange...something like that, but came in soon, very well packaged it just wasn't the color that i wanted.
Small pictures but it's super cute and fun happy I bought this
Bought this for my 14 year old as a Christmas gift. She LOVES it!!
Great, fun gift for tween or teen.
I really like this camera everyone should have one to make great memories :)
My daughter just tried it for the first time, it doesn't work and now I see it is unreturnable
it' all in chinese even the warranty card saying it's only for china....have to return it.
I take this pretty little thing everywhere!
Absolutely love my new Instax mini8! Taking night time photos can be a challenge but overall it's awesome!
Perfect size! I bring this with me everywhere I go. Super cute and just perfect!
This camera was a gift for my wife.  She had a friend who payed a lot more for this item on another site and didn't have a selection on color.  The camera takes good pictures and with the 7 in 1 kit available, you can take great instant selfies as wel as other neat filters and a fitted case to protect the camera.  This is good for scrapbooking as you might imagine.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for fun instant camera.
I got this for my daughter for Christmas. Bought it as a package or so I thought no film came with it very disappointed she couldn't use it for weeks until I got the phone in the mail. Film extremely expensive
Loveee
Great quality (vintage looking) photos & easy to set up and use. The film makes it quite expensive, but I don't plan to use it too often! Only problem I encountered was that all of the directions were not provided I n English. Luckily it was easy to figure out using the diagrams & common sense!
I purchased this as a gift for my niece and she loved  it.I have not seen the camera so going by what she told me. She said it was exactly what she wanted and was easy to operate.
Great ! I love it
My daughter loves it.
Great product but all instructions were in Chinese.
daughter loves it
I love it! It works good and mine did have the selfie mirror on it. My friends and I all enjoy it, I'm very glad I bought this.
We bought this as a Christmas gift for our 10 year old. She LOVE it and was happy with the color.
Works wonderful!
I had purchased this camera for my daughter whom is currently a junior in college.  She LOVES the color, and the pictures that it takes.  Brings it with her to parties, friend events, etc..  Don't get plain black if getting for your kid.  They have quite a few vibrant colors.
I love the way the camera looks especially since it looks like a toy but i dont like the way the pictures come out especially since they're so small.
Works perfect, was nicely shipped, takes great pictures. I am really please and going really enjoy this for my kids birthday partys.
This thing is great. GF loves it and won't stop using it. No issues at all.If your into taking photos, traveler, blogger, parents, crafter whatever you NEED to have one of these around. Well worth it.I would like to see them make one that prints larger photos (these are about the size of a credit card) but still 5 stars period. Thank you'
my 11 yr old daughter loves her camera
My daughter asked for this for Christmas but we waited and got a much better price.  She loves it.  The color is perfect.  Just as pictured.  One word of caution - it doesn't come with film :-(.
This camera is advertised as having a mirror but I order it TWICE and it is not the same product, doesn't come with a mirror. FALSE ADVERTISING do not order from here.
Tips for Taking Photos with Instax Mini!1. take good care of the camera i.e it shouldn’t be jostled or dropped because THE LENS circle thing WILL FALL OFF. You can stick it back on but there’s always a little risk involved, the first time the lens fell off I nearly got a heart attack.2. never, ever take a photo in sucky lighting (ex. Our house which is lighted purely by incandescent lamps) In fact limit indoor photos unless it’s an extremely special/candid moment that can’t be replaced. Don’t lie to yourself and think “it’ll turn out good anyway” Nuh uh3. Always pay attention to the dial and turn it. I’ve had photos come out as yellowish blanks because someone forgot to turn the dial4. do not play around with the dial and think you can judge what setting is best for the weather…the camera really is most accurate.5. Try to wear light colored clothing. Not white because the flash will react badly. Not dark/black clothing because the background of the picture (ESPECIALLY if indoors) darkens naturally and you can “Fade” into the background.6. Selfies are always best with natural light. If not, and you’re taking a selfie with a friend, remember that the person holding the camera (and therefore closest to it) is more likely to get a little bit whited out (not a lot, but a little) than the other person.7. The lens can hold a surprising amount of space/number of people in one photo. This means that if for example, you’re taking a photo of a big group of people, you don’t have to back up as much as you think. If you do their faces will have less focus. Don’t be afraid to close up a little bit. (referring here to horizontal photos of course)8. The camera can take very nice photos both vertically and horizontally. Vertically is better for portraits and closeups and is very flexible. Horizontal, however, can get you a beautiful “slice of life” feel, when you want to focus not only on the people but the background and scenery.9. The paper/material the photo is printed on is thick, white, and has a little space under the photo itself for you to write something. ALWAYS write with a thin pen Sharpie. Normal pens, ballpens, ink pens whatever bleed and smudge and look plain nasty.So maybe now you’re wondering….wow, this camera has a lot of limitations. Should I seriously get it?? And my answer….YES! Yes you should. The photos just feel so incredibly real. It’s like holding that moment in your hand. It’s so different from digital photos or even printing at Walgreens. You can look at a photo over and over again, and every time notice something good and different. It’s hard to explain, but these photos are so old timey and vivid, every one of these is like a breath of fresh air. And another thing…EVERYONE loves instant cameras….I met my cousins for the first time this winter, and I honestly feel like we really bonded over this. Every time you take a new photo, everybody hovering around like “how’d it turn out??” and you get to watch it develop (extremely interesting.) It only takes a minute for the photo to develop, but a few more for the colors to really pop.So yes….Get it. Make sure to watch a couple YouTube tips/reviews/demo vids and be sparing with the pictures, they ARE pricey!!
Awesome
i love it but i wish i bought it around this time because i got mine for 80 bucks. to be exact 82.95
I got the camera the next day and I absolutely love it!
I love the camera and I use it quite often, yet mine was off-centered. Im not sure if this is common with all of these but my friend and I both bought one from the same person and they both seemed to be off centered when the photo was taken.
I love the camera. The film is definitely affordable and the quality is great.
This camera is $110 at the store I got the same camera and the case for less than that! I love it the color is perfect. The case is really good quality.
Bought this for my daughter and she loves it! It was the perfect gift. Great picture quality also!
No selfie timer. High exposure every time. Gifted to a friend and purchased the next model up which cured these issues.
Works and my niece loves it!
Arrived on time and was packaged nicely. My sister LOVED this gift. It's what she's been wanting for a year now so she really enjoyed it. She was a little confused with the instructions but once she got it, she was able to make it work.
On time, and is so cute!
I love this camera so much! I've read it's kinda marketed for tweens and as a twenty something  heading to thirty, I have to say that adults can have just as much fun with it. I took pictures of all the kids at Christmas and gave them to the parents and they loved it. The camera works great and is easy to use. Yeah, your tween will love it, but so will you.
don't buy
My daughter gives this five stars!  She's had it for months and gets a lot of use out of it. Unfortunately the film is not cheaper.  From a parent's perspective, the quality of the photos are not good but kids love it anyway.  Worth the purchase if the kids love it.
My daughter loves her camera and uses it every time she's at her friends. If you want to make your kid happy then get it!!!
I bought this for my Fiancé and he loved it. He has a love for photography and with the little pictures that he's taken are his most important ones that he'll keep forever. We've taken pictures at night and in the day, they aren't HD pictures but they are Polaroids so they are clear enough to be scrapbooked or put in the refrigerator. I love this Polaroid, and want to get one for myself(one day)!
Excellent
Works great and super fast shipping!
Just got mine. Tested it out & the film comes up blank.
Love it
LOVE this camera. It's so easy to use, and so adorable!
Perfect for tweens.  My 11 year old daughter loves it - she got it for Christmas.  Fun for her to take picture with her friends.
Very Happy!
This camera is so adorable! The shipping was faster than anticipated, and I am so excited to use this on my upcoming trip. Perfect size camera to fit into a small bag
I LIKE TI SO MUCH
My 10 year old loves it. Takes photos and gives them away to friends. Happy girl.
My granddaughter asked for this for her 13th birthday. I was not aware that instant cameras were making a come-back. I remember the Swinger from Polaroid and was a little hesitant but the picture quality did not disappoint. He daddy is a professional photographer and he okayed the purchase and was pleased. Great for a 13 year old.
Love this instax mini 8....
My Girlfriend loves it.
My 9 year old daughter absolutely loves this camera.  I got it for her birthday and let her open it before her party because I knew she would want to use it.  Her friends were crazy about it too, and all wanted to know where they could get one.  They adored the small instant "Polaroid" type photographs, and were all sent home with a couple.  I had to police the situation because they were nearly fighting over them....I took that as a sure sign they liked them.  The camera is extremely easy to operate, and fun to use.  The pastel colors are great for young ladies.My only caution with this camera is that the film is rather expensive, and it's quite easy to just keep "clicking" with it.Remember, just like the original instant cameras,you must take one "photograph" before the film is ready to use. I made this mistake twice with a new film cartridge in....try getting a dozen 9 year olds to hold their pose again!Overall, this camera is so fun and functional, I had to give it five stars.  Although we have e not owned it for a long time yet, it seems sturdy and very well built. Even though it's plastic, it dies have some "heft" to it.Just so you are prior to purchase, this camera does not print regular "polaroid" size pictures. They are "mini" versions, but they are still very cool and the kids live them.Also be aware this does not take, or keep a digital version of you photograph.  It works just like and older instant camera; Once it prints the picture, it is gone from the camera forever.As long as you are aware of the price of film ahead of time, and do not have a problem with that; then I recommend this camera without reservation.
Have been wanting this item for a while now and decided to go ahead and purchase it. it was the best investment i could have made i love this camera and the pictures are actually very clear for such a small instant camera.
Amazing!!! Take it everywhere! Perfect modern Polaroid ❤️
Love this camera!
Dope
Love it
The idea for this camera is fun and retro but the pictures do not have good quality. I tested it out in several different lighting and areas but it cannot capture the scenery at all and most of the pictures turned out very over exposed. I returned this item for a refund.
So happy to have an instant camera in my life again. pretty inexpensive and so easy to use. i would definitely suggest buying a wholesale pack of film with it so you don't have to worry too much about wasting film as you try it out. the camera itself does not take photos well up close which can be slightly frustrating if you wanted to capture details as things tend to get washed out but thats not too much of a big deal for me as i knew what to expect.
I love this camera, but the colors are different than on the picture on the pink, the image need some improvement.
Love it !!!
So far, so good!
Great item decided to order another one but different color. :)
Picture size is rather small but the camera feels like a quality item and it is attractive.
works great!!! my daughter loves it...
Purchased this for my 11 yr old daughter for Christmas and she thinks its pretty neat. As adult remembering the old Polaroids, I just love it and will be getting one for myself soon.
Excelente
My daughter loves her camera. As a Dad though I don't think the picture quality is that great. She is 14 and takes lots of pictures. Film is quite pricey too...
gives nice picture ,sturdy
I had a Polaroid camera when I was little so naturally I wanted another instant camera! This one is so great & not to large! I love it & it makes events so fun!
Best product I ever purchased
My daughter loves this
this was a gift for our granddaughter  - and she LOVES LOVES LOVES it!  Huge hit with her and her friends at her sleep over.
This is a perfect little instant camera.  I will be creating my own photo booth at my wedding reception next month and these are perfect for my little wedding party to have fun with.
The film is expensive!!But if you're looking to take Polaroid photos this is a great tool to satisfy your craving.
Arrived on time and on good conditions, very good quality..Thanks
This was a gift for my grand daughter and she loved it.  Worked perfectly for her birthday sleep over party.
LOVED IT
I love my camera!  The pictures show in great quality and it's super cute and fun to use!
Love this camera simple and easy to use brings back nostalgia of when I was young and my parents had a camera like this
Bought this for a friend of mine. She hasn't said anything bad about it, so the instant camera most be great. Well packaged!
Love this camera!!
Absolutely love these products! Took them on a trip to Portland and had so much fun with the filters. The camera is super easy to use and all the fun attachments are great.
Great bargain at almost 1/2 the price of the cost in a retail store. My daughter loves this camera i gave her as a 17 b'day gift.
For my 14 year old. It's awesome. It's a freaking Polaroid but pics are smaller and film is .50/sheet. she LOVES it btw so who cares about moms opinion. It's on trend, fun, instant gratification, simple.
what a great way for instant pictures
I thought its included 1 pack of film? Im exciting to use it when I received my package just camera. because in the picture camera and one pack of film. Where is the film?
Gave this camera to my grand daughter for her 13th Birthday. She loves it!
Awesome
I ordered this on Saturday night I believe, it arrived yesterday on Wednesday, on time. It arrived without the batteries, which is why I haven't four stars instead of five. It wasn't super inconvenient, I mean it's not hard to get batteries. The picture quality is good, and as expected. Usually if you take a picture in your house, the background of the picture isn't pretty dark. The flash can be a bit much. Sometimes so I usually put the setting on sunny if I'm already happy withheld gusting for the most part. I bought a 50 pack of film, if you do it that way it's a lot cheaper. I also bought a (fake) leather case and a selfie lens to go with it. The view finder for the camera is a little off so leave room for there to be a slight mistake in positioning. I am pretty happy with this purchase, it would be a cute gift for a young adult in high school who is making a lot of memories or if you are going on a trip somewhere. It's just nice to have. I recommend it.
Love it!
I like this camera for my stepdaughter, however I bought it because the picture looked more pink than red. I got it yesterday and it's definitely a very deep coral and not as light pink as the picture... Should have gotten the purple. But I already wrapped it for her birthday.
Amazing!love this camera! Only thing I don't like is that you have to keep buying film,but film is cheap! Love it! Totally recommend this
Came in time and no complaints!
I receive the camera in prefect conditions. I was looking for a Polaroid camera with a great prices. This was the cheapest one I found and I am super happy with it. I absolutely love it!!
Best camera ever! Prints the cutest little pictures and fun to play with! Love poloroids
Absolutely do not buy!!! I received the camera, followed the instructions and tried shooting with it only to see that the film gets jammed. It wouldn't work no matter what and I wasted a whole thing of film. Terrible packaging and the wristband is not even the one that goes with the camera. The back door is even a different color. I'm very pissed overall, save yourself from a hassle and buy from a craft store
This is our 2nd camera. We used it at my daughter's photo booth so we didn't have to pay $300+ on one! Worked great. First pic is always a test pic. Very happy with product. Only drawback is film is pricey, unless you buy multipacks. We bought 2 multi 6packs for $75 total! 120 pics worked great for our photo booth. Also wish it took larger size film, like original Poloroid cameras, but it does a good job. Great for on the go and fun for a teenager/young adult for a night out. Better shots are taken when taken up close, otherwise quality is compromised. It's definitely a gadget for fun, If you are more seasoned photographer/hobbyist, like myself, you may be disappointed.
Great item!!
This camera is so awesome!! I love it!  It seemed cheap because its made out of plastic which I was worried about at first but after carrying it around with me for 5 days in a row it is still in perfect condition.  The pictures are so cool and vintage.  Its like a little present every time you take a photo.
The quality of the photos when taken outside is crappy, but it's great for indoor pictures
Works great and is SUPER FUN!
I love it!
Love this vintage camera
Super-fun camera.  Very easy to use.  Good quality.
Great camera
LOVE!
I bought this camera for my wife for her birthday and there is a settings nob for bright environment, shady, etc... Which didn't work, so I returned it and ordered a replacement. Then the replacement had the same problem.
Love it
It is awesome!!!Totally met my expectations!
Love it
Love it! Super cute and easy to use.
My daughter loved it a lot. She takes it to her school and takes picture with her friends. The pictures come out so cute. The camera is so pretty.
What a fun, nostalgic camera.  I guess these are very popular with the kids right now because my daughter's friends all love these too.  The Amazon price was much better than other places I've seen.
Really great and fun camera to use
I love this camera so much, I have taken nearly 20 photos since new years. Can be taken in any setting, since it has a quality flash. Just be careful before you snap a photo that it's on the correct setting, it will automatically be on house setting, but there are many options for the setting of the picture being taken. When you go to buy film buy it in bulk, much cheaper that way.
It should come with film. Major bummer.
This was just what our 16 yr. old grand daughter wanted, & she loves it.  Who knew today's kids would want a camera with film?
Description stated that batteries are included but they were not included when received.
Doesn't come with film.... just FYI! Don't make the same mistake we did! We took it to our friend's 30th birthday party and when she opened it and we went to put it together, no film :( Should come with at least a 10 pack in my opinion or clearer writing that it doesn't come with the film.
happy birthday daughter
Cutest thing ever!
The girls really enjoyed this camera and we found it to be easy to use.  Thanks!
It's came so quickly with Amazon Prime. Brand New so cute!!! And works! First camera I've ever had
The camera is great. Note, this specific one DOES NOT come with a pack of film, which I did not notice when ordering it.
Girlfriend loves it. It's cute and dainty and it still has the novelty.
I was never able to use the fujifilm! It never worked!! Such disappointment and waste of my money!
Bought it for my 12 yr old daughter .. And i WANT ONE NOW!!!!!
It's awesome :)
this came in excellent condition and my daughter is having a lot of fun using it.
Bought this as a Christmas gift for our daughter. It seems to take nice quality photos, but nothing that will blow your socks off. She loves it though, so it was worth the price.
Pictures don't turn out, horrible, waste of money
Its so cute I love it <3
Over all works good!! I love it, and really enjoy taking polaroids!!! The only prpblem, is the settings DO NOT change. So i cannot take cute photos at the beach in the sun:(  they just come out white. i heard people return theirs but i didnt wanna go through all that. It sucks. But over all i like this camera .
my niece was happy
My wife loves the camera. So far she is having a lot of fun with it. The seller shipped it right away and it arrived in a few days unscathed and in brand new condition.The only bad thing is that this camera is definitely NOT PINK. It is a weird shade of orange. We were going to send it back but my wife was too excited to play with it and decided to just settle and live with the off color. Hopefully there is a case or something I can buy for her.
This was a gift and she loved it!
Love this! the first picture I took was beautiful and I couldn't believe how every picture turns out really well. I usually don't get excited enough about something to write a good review but this is definitely worth it. I love it I love it I love it.
Cool little gift, lots of fun for the money.
Grand daughter loved the camera, uses it all the time.
Super cute! Perfect for taking pictures of special memories
It was a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loved it! It arrived quickly and was everything we hoped it would be.
I cannot wait to take this everywhere with me. I got a carrying case separately. My camera, sadly, did not come with the wrist strap! I took a picture of my plant... enjoy.
The camera came exactly as I expected, no surprises. It even came a day early! Great quality product, with the only downside that I can't take more than 10 photos per film cartridge. But there are so many bulk offers of film available online, even that isn't too disappointing. I highly recommend this product. Get snap-happy, my friends!
Love it!! It's nice and light. I did the faster shipping took two days. Ordered on Febuary 11,2016 and it got her Febuary 13, 2016 ans a little before 11:00 Am. So I really love it. It came with everything cause u ordered the camera accessories too so it was faboulus. I feel very kawaii!
Love it
I  gave this to my 8-year-old granddaughter for Christmas, and she loved it! She was visiting from out of town, recorded all her activities while she was with us, then went home with visual memories of her visit.
Great camera, awesome idea for a gift.
My teenager love  this camera and the instant pictures
No idea why the kids have drifted back to this style, but the film is insanely high priced, no use without the film, IMO if this had digital option, I would say sure, but this was a gift for a niece who really wanted it, so can't complain, just scratching my head as to why they would want them
This is a perfect gift, my daughter love it...
My daughter loves this camera and it takes great pictures.  So easy and fun to use.  A must for every girl to have!
I purchased 15 of these in assorted colors for a theme party.  Everyone also received a small photo album and two packs of film with instructions to use it tonight!  So much fun with a group of 30-40 yo women who had Polaroid cameras growing up.  Everyone enjoyed the photo keep sakes and then they took them home where their children had fun playing with the camera.Only downside is the coast of film at almost $1 per picture.  In the digital age you have to remind the kids every shot counts!
Bought this for my daughter for her birthday--she's used it nonstop since.  One caveat--the photos are about half as wide as typical Poloraids were when I was growing up--only about 2 inches wide.
I love it!!
my daughter loves this camera she is always taking pictures with it
My Grand daughter is just having TOO much fun with this. It was a Christmas gift. Now all she wants for gifts is more film. Pictures are clear and "fun" size.
Made a great gift for my best friend, she loves it and was so happy to receive it. It's adorable, lightweight, and intuitive to use, even for people who are used to digital photography.
My daughter loves it. Brings back some old memories
I am absolutely in love with this polaroid camera!! It works wonderfully and produces quick and well-processed pictures easily. The film can be expensive so buying in bulk is usually the best option. Although the camera is difficult to fit in small-medium sized purses for day trips, it's a vacation must and an adorable accessory!!
A good buy for my daughter for Christmas she loves the camera and she gets a lot of use out of it only problem is is it's disposable film so expect to pay a lot and keep on paying for film
Got it opened it and loved it takes awesome pictures that look real retro
It captures great pictures. It's actually my new favorite toy. I love it so much. Good for travels, I wouldHighly recommend.
I love love love this camera!
I'm over joyed with this! No complaints!!
Very cute'' nice for unedited, candid pictures. Let be real, I hadn't developed the pictures on my phone for over 3 years! And now I have a ton of pictures :) yay love it! I would never have tangible pictures for scrapbooking ''''''
My daughter loves it. Works great.
So much fun!
BEST PURCHASE I'VE EVER MADE!!! I'm so in love with this camera and the price was great and shipping was so fast! Thank you 💕
Bought this as a Christmas present and wasnt used straight away and tesed to see if it works. It does not work. Bateries and film inside, it turns on a red light but the shutter button does not work to take a picture. Dissapointment
Retro!  My daughter has a chance to see how my parents did it back in the day.  She has pictures on the wall already.
Loved it, super cute, awesome pictures, but after a few days, the pictures in the sunlight come out with "ghost-like" marks, like white shadows. Pretty upset about it
Love it !
Awesome Product!!
GAVE IT AS A GIFT TO OUR GRAD DAUGHTER
It is a nice camera, but it was suppoused to came with 20 pictures, and it came in an open box and just the cam. I think I was stolen somehow...
very nice for 1st camera for my grandaughter,she loved it!
Great camera, does exactly what it says on the box, four stars because the film is pricey, understandable in this day and age but still a little more than I'd like to pay. The camera is a great price though. Build quality is stellar, the lens mechanism feels well made and the camera feels like it will stand up to a lot. We're using it at our wedding, great for a wedding scrapbook.
Absolutely cute!  I didn't even realize there were different editions when I ordered this. It's the newer model and my daughter was very happy. Grabbed the accessory variety pack to go along w it. Very pleased with the products and services.
We live in an age where smartphone cameras and social media have made photography and digital content accessible to just about anyone, at anytime, and at any place. Scrolling through Instagram and Snapchat feeds is both entertaining and sometimes adventurous. I am constantly amazed at people’s creativity.But sometimes our propensity to binge on media can dull our senses and cheapen our experiences. The intangible but infinite nature of digital content can leave us wanting. I mean, who hasn’t stayed up until the wee hours of the night browsing through their phone, wondering why life feels so empty in that moment? Existential crises have a tendency to arise when we sit unchecked in front of glowing blue screens.This is why I really appreciate instant film cameras. They are self-limiting. Taking a photo requires us to slow down and really think a shot through. And only one person can take a photo home. Pictures and memories become what they once were: rare, precious gifts.For these reasons I purchased the Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera for my wife. We instantly fell in love with it. For someone who wants their gear to be as artsy as the pictures they take, the Instax Mini 8 is the best instant film camera you can buy. The name of the product is a mouthful but it’s form and function are simple.FormThe Instax Mini 8 has a solid build quality and doesn’t feel cheap. My wife usually carries it in her purse and we’ve yet to find any discernible scratches on the body. However, if you are concerned about scratching the lens you can find cases online.The camera just looks good. The angles and curves are elegant, giving off less of the “box-look” found in other instant cameras. These curves make the camera comfortable to hold, whether you’re taking normal pictures of selfies. There is also a vast selection of colors to choose from to fit personality type or outfit.FunctionThe camera has two buttons. The button adjacent to the lens turns the camera on and the other functions as the shutter. They’re simple to use and unobtrusive to the design.The Instax Mini 8 also has different aperture settings depending on the lighting and environment. It will automatically recommend the best setting for you with a flashing LED.The viewfinder accurately frames shots. Pictures will come out looking like what you see in the viewfinder. The film chamber is also in the back. Inserting and ejecting film cartridges is quick and easy. There is also a film counter on the bottom right that displays the remaining amount of film in the camera.Image quality is what you’d expect from instant film. It is crucial to use the correct aperture settings on your shots. I accidentally used the indoor lighting setting at times so the pictures came out brighter than we expected.I can’t recommend the Instax Mini 8 Instant Camera enough. It makes a perfect gift for your wife, friend, girlfriend, or yourself. The pictures it takes will have a personal touch to them that will mean more to you and whoever you share your pictures with.This review was originally published by Geekskills at WordPress.
I love it! If buying a Polaroid, buy a lot of film and have fun with it. I've received a lot of compliments, it's easy to use, make sure to check the lighting settings before taking a picture!
Buy this camera. Just do it.
I got this for my 10 year old niece but I ended up using it all night long. I loved it. The pictures look great, the caMera is nice and solid and it looks cute. My niece loves it as well and has done lots of diy photo projects with it.
Works great!!! So cute and such a great idea. My friends have even bought their own after using mine. Highly recommend.
I am sending this back for a refund.  The color and clarity of the pictures is terrible.
We bought this for our 12 year old daughter who loves snapping photos of everyone and was wanting to start scrap booking (but I was rarely wanting to stop everything to print for her).The camera is simple enough she's been able to figure out how to use it with minimal help, she's thrilled with it and loves being able to instantly have her pictures.It's definitely just the old polaroid idea - just with smaller pictures (in a bit cuter format). Definitely stock up on the extra film though, we've noticed she does go through it ;-) And it does have to be bought separately.
It's nice..
Love it! The film is a little smaller than I expected but it had great quality, easy to use, relatively compact. The film packs are 10shot ea. so be sparing! The different light sensing modes work pretty well. All of my films have been clear and look awesome. Great deal here on amazon also.
Fast delivery & good product
My daughter thought this was the greatest thing ever made, she did not know the joys of an instant camera and had fun using this with her friends
Love the product! The manual is came with was easy to read and understand. A must-have for anyone who loves taking pictures!
New, unopened and in good condition.No fails yet.4 stars as the delivery was a bit later than the est. delivery.Overall happy with the product.
LOVE THIS CAMERA! So glad I bought it, its so much fun to use and it takes really good pictures if you make sure to change the light settings. I've dropped it probably 15 times too and sometimes from pretty high up and its still working. So its durable but obviously I don't recommend dropping it. I should probably buy a case for it at some point.
Everything great as expected
No problems with the film, easy to use.
Well my product never arrived but I am very grateful to Amazon for fixing my problem fast! I went out and purchased one of these at target (it wasn't this pretty color of course) and I am very happy with my purchase. Will definitely be buying another as a gift.
my granddaughter loves it!
Bought camera for wedding
I think the pictures should be a little better quality than what it produces.  When I was young, the pictures weren't so off in a distance.  You literally have to get on top of your subject in an effort to get a half-way decent picture of them.
Thank you.
Great mini camera.  Picture quality was ok for selfies.. My niece enjoyed it
Great present for my teenage daughter.
Girlfriend loves it
Love it! So cute and light. Everything I expected it to be and more!
great camera, my daughter loves it
I love my mini camara, it takes beautiful pictures. definately will take it with me my next vacations. wish did't have to order the case and other things separate.
I like the camera
Great gift for a tween!
My daughter loves this camera, particularly the selfie feature.  These are small photos, but perfect for what she wants them for.
Everything I expected! :)
best Polaroid ever. 100% recommend!
This camera is the cutest thing and works so well! I love it!!
Very bad item
Love
Very well received and thoroughly enjoyed.  Great photos too!
My daughter uses it when her friends come over, but is a little to large for a teenager to travel with.
I love love loveee it. I was a bit hesitant to buy it because of the price. Great quality for the the price. And it literally shipped in one day. So satisfied 🙌🏼
Its cool. Love the color, shape and size.  The only drawback is its a bit hard to figure out the light setting to use in different situations.  It takes a couple pics to get it right.
Amazon prime
Wonderful product
Amazing i live it
Had no problems with it! (: MUST GET!
Once you passed the initial emotion, you realize this is not practical nor economic to use.  So If you have the extra bucks and don't care small unique pictures (no copies possible), then it's a nice TOY.  I bought this for my doughter, she's happy with it... so far.  Let's wait until picture cartridge is finished... :(
This is such a hit with friends. I have used this at a friend's baby shower for guests to pin photos with a wish for the baby written on them and also took it to a nearby orphanage. The photos are a great party favor.
I bought this for my daughter's 11th birthday. She absolutely loves it. It's easy to use and the cartridges are simple to put in. The film is a little expensive but she loves this camera. She's putting together a scrapbook with her pictures. I wish I would've bought one for myself.
this camera honestly is the best thing ever.. i was kinda iffy to buy at first because of all the things people were saying about it being defective but so far it's turned out great. this one thing i really love about it is that the cameras flash will literally make your face look flawless af.
Awesome small camera to carry around anywhere and takes very cute unique photos! Love love love mine
My fifteen year old loved it.  She and her friends were bewildered by the development of the pictures.
The rasberry color is NOT PINK! It is RED! My daughter was disappointed so I just wanted to let you know. Also does not come with any film so be sure to order some.
The picture pops out the top like a toaster! Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehe
great pictures
A fun camera. Having a tangible image in-hand seems to be bring excitement back to photography, especially, to the "miliennials." I hope Fuji can increase the format size, in the future.
I love this camera.!
Awesome
It was really nice and pictures came out great awesome gift for my girlfriend and it was a quick delivery very nice!!!👏👏👏
I was missing the side piece for the battery and the inside battery metal was bent i couldn't even get the battery in it. Overall bad condition the focus also springs back and doesn't even click it's a swap meet quality and I'm returning it tomorrow SMH.
SERIOUSLY SO MUCH FUN!!! buy this camera! i love love love it. nothing like the instant gratification an instant film camera gives you. :)
Super cute color. Pics are very good quality!
so fun a bit bulgy, but i love it!
Absolutely great. This tiny camera takes some of the best pics ever. I very highly suggest this product
They only reason my wife gave it 2 stars is because the color is not as advertised. Awesome camera but we had to return it. We ordered the "Raspberry" color but got a weird faded looking, red color. I put a picture down below. It looks even more strange in person. Returning for the regular "Pink".
My daughter loves this camera!  Pictures come out clear & camera quality is great!  Def brings it back to when I use to use a polaroid 30 years ago.  ;)
Feels cheap.  Takes terrible pictures.  Half of the pictures never developed so I suspect the film is bad.  Will try a new film but do not hold out much hope.  Very disappointed!
It was everything I expected. I was worried about buying it but its simple, affordable, and just everything I expected.
Works good. But is weak with poor ligth
The camera does not work when we got it... probably not a good quality so now i have to look for another brand
Nice
This was my 7 year old niece's favorite birthday gift, she flipped out.  She wouldn't stop playing with it all day, carried it everywhere with her.  The only bummer is the cost of the film, it's a little high.
Bought this for our girls for Christmas - they have had so much fun with it. Easy to use. Easy to load the film into.. of course they are going through a lot of film but thier smiles and laughter even it out!
I ordered this for my daughter & she loves it.
INSTANT PCITURES! My wife absolutely love this camera. It brings a totally different feel to taking pictures knowing that it is limited, unlike the unlimited photos on a phone. There's always the mind set that it costs over $1 per picture though we always have to make sure our smiles are right. Every picture so far has been great. The retro look is cool.
Works as expected.
LOVE IT! It's so fun to capture memories with this Instax camera! I got mine for $65 when my friend got hers in stores for $100!
My daughter loves her new camera.  Color is nice and bright.  Easy to use.
Great camera! Bought this for my 10 year old daughter, she loves it. Takes nice pictures.
I absolutely love this!!! It met my expectations greatly!
Grand daughter loves this camera. Now older daughter wants one!
Love it! Film is too expensive though!
Bought for my daughter for Christmas and so far it has been good. Takes good instant photos. Not professional or digital quality. Great for my kids to make scrap book or photo albums.
I just received my fujifilm instax mini 8!!! So far, so good! It is everything I expected it to be. I hope it continues to be a well worth buy. <3
This camera is cute! I ended up returning it because I just didn't see myself using it, but it's an awesome gift for kiddos !! Brings back memories
Very cute, soft yellow color. Takes great insta photos. We took this with us to NYC and my daughter used it to take photos of the sights in NYC. It takes great photos and it's a blast from the past with the insta photos.
love it
Extremely cute I love it
It doesn't work at all. Do not know why. Doesn't turn on. I check the batteries. Use a nwe pair because I thought that maybe the included were wrong but nothing :'(
A pretty cool device but their are some flaws on it. The switch botton is kinda near the view finder. It would cause ur finger to block it. Sensor can be improve making it faster to.switch mode. Great buy for a price but the film is kinda pricy. So make sure make a great pose and smile before you shoot.
Awesome little camera with a vintage look!
I received the camera and the seal was broken on the bottom of the box and there was no inside. The box looks very Worn.  stinks because I'm giving as a gift. I'm asking for replacement.
My 24 year old daughter has LOVED this since the day we got it! Film is a little pricey, but you know that before you buy it, so worth it in our book!
loveee!
I'm in love with this camera the moment I opened it in the box!!! This is so fun and so cute!!!
I really like my camera. I got the raspberry color and its almost a rust color so its not too girly for my husband to snap a picture here or there.The only con is that the pictures I took inside were a little darker than Id like.
I'm in love with it! great product!
My 11 year old loves this!! It is reminiscent of the pics you seen as a kid but better and a little smaller so cool!!
Absolutely love this camera!!
Cool camera and even cooler pictures.  Perfect for our 8 year old.
Brand new, item came as described and love the instant pictures! Very happy and glad I decided to buy this.
My four year old had so much fun with it! Easy to aim and shoot! And he did all 20 pix well!
Love it!!!
perfect
Pictures are not that great but my daughter llikes it.
Works great! Cute design
great camera for my teenage daughter.  The film is rather costly
daughter loves it
Great camera and perfect gift. Only downside is that it does not come with film so be sure to purchase film with the camera!
Great camera came in 6 days new awesome quality it was exactly how I expected
I bought this camera for my girlfriend on our anniversary and she loved it so much!
Came a day later than 2-day priority.
This camera is amazing. The photos look great, the camera is easy to use. 10/10.
Easy to work with. Lots of fun.
Best substitute since the polaroid 600 :)
I love the camera but the pics are very small. When the pics come out, the actual size of the pic is Smaller than the size of a credit card.
Received the camera, followed all the directions, went to turn it on and NOTHING!!! It doesn't work at all!! Getting my money back!
So amazing!! Pictures even better than I thought they would be!
I brought it for my daughter for Christmas and she love it as well as others. I tell them that I bought it off of Amazon.  I like the little photos it reminds me when I was a little girl we had cameras that printed out poloriod it comes to show you how things have a way of coming back around
She is off at college and just loves it!
Excellent
I love this little camera. Shipping took a little longer than I hoped for but product is great. Fun, portable and cute. Went through so much film already. Only thing about it, is you have to make sure you put the light setting on the one it tells you to or your pictures may turn out over lighted or dark.
Great buy 😁
Got this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  Unfortunately I had to send it back because it wouldn't print pictures.
small pictures but good for what it does.
So cool and nostalgic with great picture quality.  Was a gift for my 8 year old and she had no problem taking great pics and was very easy to use and very fun!
Love this item!! Great buy! Great quality !
Granddaughter loved her birthday gift. Film is a little pricey but she is using the camera wisely.Well packaged.
Good deal.
Bought as a gift for my daughter. She loved it!!
Bought this for daughters 18th birthday! She loves it! Little bit of a learning curve with framing the shot. Takes me right back to the 70's!
This camera has made my life a whole new world XD I love it I have taken so many pics with me and my friends and family they love it too I bought this thinking this camera is my first make the best of it and from the first day It arrived  (on my birth day) I was so happy Amazon said that it would be here on Feb first I was so sad then it said it was coming right at 8 o-clock on my birth day I was so happy and I could take some pics while some people where leaving it came just in time and my birth day was the best the Amazon
I rarely leave reviews but this time I feel this camera is worth the trouble. I bough two of these one for me and one for my daughter as a gift. We both love it and recommended it for my brothers. I took it to the family gathering and gave it to the children to take a few shots. We laughed a lot at photos taken by them and one of my brothers said he'd bring one for his daughter. It is sold in a bookstore here in Riyadh but it is cheaper at Amazon. I like the accessories especially the frames and the album. In fact, this is the main reason we bought it. I am giving it 4 stars because the picture is too small. It is not good to capture events or scenes. It is good for selfies with friends and family.
Bought for my daughter....LOVE LOVE LOVE...it's an instant camera so the pics look a bit vintage.  If you want digital quality, buy a digital camera.  If you want a super cute vintage print to hang in the shappy chic room...this is for you.  Pics are approx credit card size.
This was for my ex girlfriend u.u never got to enjoy it.
Cool!
Finally a gift for my teenage granddaughter she really likes and uses!
Arrived as expected
Got one for my sister and she loves it
It is a really good camera
Poor quality photos but retro, I suppose.
Poor picture quality plus film that cost about $1 per shot = terrible product.
Huge hit and Amazon had the best price!
Loved it! Just what i expected!
Happy with my product!
Our granddaughter is having fun with the camera
Excellent, easy to use, love the size of the photos! They are so fun to watch develop.
Bought for my 6 year old and she absolutely loves it. Pictures are clear and the camera is very sturdy. Has been dropped several times and still works with no issues.
My daughter loves her new camera, came fast too
Love it
Fun little camera.  My 12 year old daughter LOVES hers!!
I bought this for my daughter. Film is pricey but it is what she wanted.
Bought this for my little sister. She loves it! I wish film was cheaper but it's great anyways.
Love this. I've wanted one for so long. I wish the pictures were a little bigger. But I knew what I was getting, so no effect on the rating.
Came just as expected ! Came in perfect condition! Also came with batteries and a string for the camera. Absolutely love it !
Just as advertised.
Works PERFECTLY! Such a worth it buy. (:
Great product
5 star
The Polaroid camera is back! We have had a lot of fun using this camera in a variety of ways. You go through the film very quickly and it isn't cheap. I wouldn't use this on a regular basis, but for special parties and events it is a lot of fun.
love it!
My daughter loves this instant film camera. Fuji should have 2 types of film, the current size and the original polaroid size. Other than that, works great.
A
The official camera, so cute and so pretty
It did not come with film :( had to wait a long time before I could take any pictures because I had to order the film separately but it came with batteries!
My daughter has had so much fun taking Pics :)
Such a fun camera! Really great for scrapbooks or wall decor. People always complements and adores the photos and the camera whenever they see it.
Great for fun projects!
Arrived very fast!! cute camera my niece loves it
So much fun to use!
Works well. Came complete. No complains
This is so much fun and good pictures
Lens got stuck within first week
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Perfect gift for s teen. My teenager loves it!
Wasn't sent in English and have to send it back its not taking pic there all blank
Very simple to use, just point and shoot. Great for all ages to use. I love the spontaneity and novelty of the pictures (which most people may not). The softness of colors, slight viginettes, and other effects due to the nature of the camera make every photo look vintage. I will attach some photos when I have time. For first time instant camera owners, I'd recommend buying a bulk pack of film (even if you don't get a lot of user-errors with photos, you'll just want to keep taking and taking them) as well as an accessories set if you like to play around with photography. I purchased the NODARTISAN package, which brings lots of cute filters, a case, and other items.
Fell off the couch and broke after 1 week
bought this for my son and hes had fun with it.
I was about to give five stars for this review when I found out that the strap of the camera was missing. Ouch
Excelent purchases
Love this product! The film is expensive but definitely worth it. Photos come out great!
bought it as a gift and my daughter loves it
Scored some nice girlfriend points for this camera.... thanks!!!!Works as expected, and its really fun too!
This camera was bought for my daughter who absolutely loves it!
Great gift to give
This camera works real well and good for the price. I use it plentiful and no problems so far. It is well designed and better than the previous model. I recommend getting this and a designed film to make the photo look even better! It is easy to use and lightweight! I would've liked there to be a little more to the camera but for the price it is fair.
Love this camera! Everyone had so much fun taking pics with this at the birthday party! & Everyone wanted one after they played with it! =] It was a really cute and clever party favor for the parents and kids to take home with them! I think the picture turns out really nice as long as your up close and personal with good lighting! =]
didnt work... felt so bad for my daughter she was really looking foward to it
100% PERFECT!
Camera arrived faulty, pictures do not develop at all no matter how much film I use
Love it. Takes cute pictures
The camera it's self is amazing only thing is if you get it there is no film with the camera. You would have to go but it separately. When I got mine the battery wasn't working,So if you get it make sure you have film and extra batteries .
great
My granddaughter is having so much fun with this camera.
Easy to use, super cute and portable. This does not come with written English instructions, but picture instructions, which at first were slightly confusing, but ultimately understandable. It is a hit at all parties I take it to!
This camera is incredibly cute, and as an owner of the rose one, I must say that I love the color. It also has a nice weight to it without being heavy, and pretty easy to use.
This camera is super cute and instant. I loved it ! I got it very fast and had no problems with it whatsoever ! It's the best . No regrets ! :)
Nice
Doesn't work, all pictures come out white after using 2 separate film roles, both came out white. Very disappointed with this purchase.
Fun little camera to play with!!
Great love it
I love it. It takes great pictures.  The only problem was that none of the directions were in English . We used the pictures and common sense to put it together.
How can you not love a Polaroid? This is awesome plus it was for a discount, win win for us! Even my little girls likes to play with it !
My daughter loves this camera
My niece is in love with this camera! I got it for her for Xmas and she is so happy with it. The pictures come out really nice and it's nostalgic for everyone to see Polaroids again!
I LOVE ITTT!! <3 its so pretty :3..It come with battery and the strap... It came within a week and two days for me. Packaging is in good hand/ wrap in bubble wrap haha. But still need to learn how to take a really good picture ahah
soo cute!
Such a fun camera.  Easy to use.  We purchased for our 14 year old as a birthday gift.
This camera and case arrived on time and brought a huge smile to my granddaughter. She loves it.
I ordered a black one and from the day I started using it I knew it was totally fake because it wouldn't change the filters at all. I'm going to return mine asap and I expect my money back.
Great
Purchased for 9 year old daughter.  Nice camera, very expensive film.
I bought this as a birthday gift for my 9 year old niece. She loved it and thought that it was really cute. The adults loved it too because it reminded us of the old Polaroid cameras from our childhoods!  The only negative is having to buy film.
Okay, but a bit of a teen toy.  Does not take quality photos at all, but it was fun for a party.
Super fun. Wish the film wasn't so pricey. I've been toting this thing around with me everywhere.
My sister loved her gift!
Daughter loves it.
This was order for my sister and she absolutely loves it! It's a gorgeous color.
Came fast love it
Takes a great picture
My granddaughter loved her Christmas present.
Delivered as defective-> flash did not work. I purchased this right before my tralvel date, so i could not claim so unlucky
My daughter in law love it!
I was a bit disappointed on the delivery time it was late. But my daughter loves it.
Very nice! My niece liked it very much. =)
I got mine in the mail today. SO EXCITED. I took the first picture & the flash was extremely dull. The picture came out black. I tried researching how to fix it online & it said the best solution was to replace the bulb for the flash. :( Sounds like too much of a hassle for me. So I wanted a thing of film & am getting ready to return it. I bought another one because I still REAALLY want one. hopefully this one works! fingers crossed
Came right on time. Great product! !
Such an amazing camera!
My daughters favorite Christmas present.
Great product, pictures come out great
Loved it. Great purchase
Love this camera.
My mom loved this Christmas present!!!!!!!!!!!
Very good. Love the price.. works PERFECTLY....
absolutely love my little camera! shipped in under a week and it hasn't left my side since!
my grand daughter loves her camera!
Love this camera so much! Utterly obsessed, would definitely recommend this!!
This item is great my daughter loves it, and I received on the day I was given.
Adorable camera. Brings back the timeless Polaroid like no other.
I got my camera in Grape and it was my present to myself for working so hard all year. I love this camera. My son loves it because a picture slides up at the top lol
Bought it for a gift and my niece loved it.  Great product
Girlfriend loves it, takes  small but clear pictures and the custom Polaroid film makes it even cooler.
Camera ok but didnot receive any instructions so just have to guess at how to use.
Nice
12-year old daughter had no trouble figuring out how to get it loaded and ready to snap photos.Of course, first thing she did with the photos was take pictures on them with her tablet to post on Instagram....
The camera was a gift for my granddaughter and she's delighted with it.
love it.
Very good
Loving this camera!
I am so happy that I got this! I was literally screaming and everything while I was opening it and putting the film in. Thank you so much! Mine doesn't make a suppose 'sound' when you turn it on, but I don't really care. Buy this!
Thank you; what I wanted.
Great birthday present for my daughter.
A bit expensive for what you get. Disappointed that you don't get any photo paper.
Nice camera. Although it's easy to waste a shot because the settings aren't highly customizable. Also, once you're out of film, there's no point in using this camera! I wish I bought the Snap Polaroid because it's SD card supported. But hey I don't care because this was a gift to my GF and she liked it. So.... Whatever!
My Granddaughter was happy to get the extra film. She us having lots if fun with her friends.
This is a great and easy camera to use. It is a great quality camera that you can carry around with you at all times.
Just what she wanted. Thanx.
Not for everyday.  Film is $$. But fun to mess around with.
This camera is fantastic!  These marketing folks really need to pat themselves on the back for bringing Polaroid-style cameras back.  The color is so beautiful and I just know my daughter will love it!  (P.S.  I want one for myself O_O)
love it. pictures are so cute!
Wish the viewer was correct and didn't have to move the lens right and up to center photo. Why even put it in there? Camera itself is pretty freaking awesome though. Love giving photos right away to people. 4/5.
Worked for 1 day.  The settings dial stopped working.  Now it will only take pis with a flash
absolutely LOVE this, reminds me of being a kid again! highly recommend!
daughter is very pleased
Got this for my 15 year old daughter for Christmas!  She loves it!! The only problem is gonna be buying all this film!!
Fun camera
This camera is awesome,it's light and easy to hold. It takes really cool looking photos too. It's a great choice if you want an instant camera but can't afford the old Polaroid film.
My granddaughter loves this camera.  Reminds me of my childhood polaroid only better.  The pictures are very clear too.
Pictures are very small.
Super nice!!!
I really happy with this purchase
This is a retro throwback to the Polaroid cameras of the 70's and early 80's.The pictures that come out look awful due to fixed lens focal length, and it has to process the shot internally.If you have won the lotto or are a silver spoon trust fund baby by all means get one, but at $1.00 per picture for film you would be crazy to buy this thing in my opinion. My daughter begged for one for Christmas and I told her she had to buy the film, it went against every fiber of my being to purchase such antiquated tech. Now that the film all gone it's a paperweight laying around the house.It's well built, seems to function ok so far, it comes in god awful colors at least I bought the black one, if it was pink or baby blue I would have tossed the paperweight that it is with no film, out the window.Don't buy this it's antiquated junk in my opinion.
Well received. Work great.
Bring the good old days back with this one. You wont get HD prints out of this but you will get a quality photo right then and there. The camera itself seems built to last. It may be a bit pricey for the technology but as always Amazon had the best price that I found at any box store.
I was super pleased at how easy it is to use and the fact that you can write names, dates etc on the bottom of it
Love!!! Absolute love
It's a neat little camera, but we seem to get a lot of pictures that won't develop.
Favorite gift of Christmas!  Love the retro design and color.
LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera. Easy to use, I haven't dropped it so I wouldn't know how durable, but it's plastic so I guess it'd be ok if your clumsy. Takes swell pictures. Sometimes the pics come out too dark, but it's not the cameras fault. Bad lighting is all. I recommend this. And the price is fair.
Very fun to use but the camera hole is kinda small hard for people with glasses to get a good picture
funky
This was a big hit at our Christmas Party!  Everyone kept asking where I had purchased it.  Amazon has everything!
A+++++
Awesome!!!
Doesn't come with any of the paper (film).  Gave as gift only to watch all at the party wonder what a picture might look like.
This camera is so cute and came in very good packaging also. I recommend to buy it here since its much cheeper for the same product you buy at any other store for $120. I got the Blue one amd its the same exact color as shown!
Bought for my 11 year old for Christmas and has lived it. Film is a little pricey, but she's learned to be more selective with pictures she takes with it.
Device as expected! Good stuff and very fast arriving to my place
Bought it for vacation
it was for my 10year old niece and sent it to Korea. my brother  opened it for her and did turn on by instruction. he said the camera turned on but after one time trying to take picture, the film jammed and never worked again. I need refund!! it turned out to be a ashamed gift. I am so upset. \./
The camera was a favorite Christmas gift and the yellow was the perfect color choice for my granddaughter.  (Made me a really popular grannie)
Love this camera. Was a perfect gift for my daughter. She loves the fact it prints the picture after you take it. Only downfall is it can only do ten pictures on one thing of film and that gets a little pricey. But all in all great camera and great gift.
I got this for my 8 year old. She loves it.
My 19 year old daughters favorite gift!
I bought it for my sister, and she absolutely loves the camera, the pictures always turn out really pretty, everyone looks good on the pictures, alwaays haha.
It is the best!!! It is so easy to use and so much fun.
My 13 year old daughter was very excited
My daughter was happy!
Granddaughter loves this camera.
Great throwback to the original Polaroid cameras! The pictures are small, but right up the alley to my daughter who received it as a gift.
The picture came out dark but I my daughter loves it so I guess it works out
It's big and bulky. But that's to be expected. The pictures are small and usually dark. You can still see the image, but darker than usual. It still has that blurryness like the old pics.
Loved IT
Love it
All good.
Love it! Picture quality came out wonderful
Arrived very fast. Great quality.
This is one of my favorite products that I have bought recently.  It is very user-friendly and easy to use. My 9-year old niece can operate it easily.You would not believe how excited people get when this comes out at a party or event!  The older crowd gets that "Polaroid nostalgia" and those that are too young to remember instant cameras are completely fascinated by it!
I bought this on June 25th and it will not work. The pictures either turn out black or white, I've read and followed all of the instructions and it said that my camera needs to be sent back. I payed more than $60 dollars for a camera that does not work so I would like to have my camera replaced. I've wasted 3 packages of film trying to get it to work.
Love it!
My daughter really enjoys her camera.  She needs more film.
I bought this for my little sister (age 14). She didn't ask for this gift or expect it. The look on her face was priceless when the picture came out of the camera.You have to get up really close to people when you take the picture. Keep this in mind since the film is very expensive.
Loved it! Used it at a Hannukah community event to take pics of kids and the kids put them in the holiday frames they decorated. Obviously the pics don't come out like regular photos with normal camera, but I didn't expect it to. Kids really enjoyed it. Only problem is that as all the reviews stated, the film is very expensive. I wish it were cheaper. Otherwise, GREAT camera, GREAT price, GREAT buy!
I bought this for my 11 year old daughter for a Christmas gift. It was the only thing she asked for. It was exactly as described and is so easy to use. We've both had fun with it!! The only problem I have is the film is pretty pricey for only 10 pictures per package of film.All in all I'm super happy with the purchase and so is my daughter!
Bought this for my 12 year old. It was exactly what she wanted. Easy enough for her to set up and put film in even without reading directions.
I love this thing so much, I'm buying both my nieces one for Christmas.
My graanddaughter requested this camera for Christmas and seems pleased with it. I bought the warranty for loss or breakage because she has lost a camera in the past.
Súper dooper!! WHAT a blast!!!
It's a little Polaroid. It's fun to play with.
Granddaughter loved it.
My daughter got this for Christmas & just loves it!  She is having so much fun with her friends & family and is loving the pictures on her wall!
first of all, this camera is amazing. it is super adorable and i love it! the first picture i took came out perfect. after that they were all blank! i checked amazon reviews and i saw that if you take out the package after it is started, the pictures have been exposed to light and they will come out blank. luckily, i had bought a few more packs so i made sure not to mess around with those. just make sure not to open the back after the pack is started, or the pack will be ruined. i gave it four stars because it is perfect but the company didnt write about that and i lost so much money.i just wanted to give you that tip before you start taking pictures.
disappointed the instructions are in Chinese!
exelent
I've been wanting an Instax Mini for years and I finally treated myself! I couldn't be happier. I was able to try out one in person before. I fell in love instantly with a memory developed right in front of your eyes. It's cool to have. I know it's going to be sort of an investment with the film, but I think it makes everything more worth while and buying the twin pack from Amazon is the best deal for that. I've always been a huge fan of photo booth pictures so this camera is right up my alley. I like to really think about the photo before taking it to insure I get what I want. It's nice to think of the perspective and lighting and background of each photo. I just love being able to have a physical copy right away, it's romantic. I also love the pink color of the camera, it's so cute and my friends love it too. The camera shape itself is sort of large in my hands, but it's really easy to use. I'd recommend it if you're interested!
Super cute! I love the pictures. I ordered the camera with the twin pack of film and I'm not sure if you'd get any film if you do not purchase the camera on its own (mentioning this because I almost skipped out on buying the extra film since I assumed it came with some). But all in all I love it!
I was really excited to receive this camera but pretty disappointed that it didn't work on the trip I wanted to use it on. Not really sure what I did wrong because it worked fine inside but when I tried to take pictures outside it wouldn't develop properly. Guess I have to stick to taking pictures inside.
Other than the fact that the product was not I'm English it works great. Good thing we didn't need to read the directions.
Camera feels more like a toy, not a real camera. Pictures are just for fun. Not great quality.
great for a gift or something fun for yourself. i bought an extra pack of film separately but it does come with a pack of 10 prints!!
my 14 year old daughter loves it! Great keepsakes of memories instantly! Christmas was extra special this year!
great
Daughter laugs and cute
Fun camera, takes great photos in any lighting situation. Great choice for an instant camera and the film is much cheaper than polaroid exposures.
bought this for my gf she loved it exactly what i expected and what she wanted worth the money and there pretty durable drop it about twice already still works perfect lol
Camera works as expected taking excellent photos!
This is a super fun camera. Enjoyed it at Christmas went the family. The teenagers actually enjoyed it!  Perfect credit card size pics. I've given twice as a gift I since my  original purchase!
Bought this for a Christmas gift. They seem to be happy with it.
This camera would have been worth 5 stars had the camera not came in with technical malfunctions. It was stuck on one setting the entire time, the houses symbol setting. Taking any picture outside and the photos always came out either all black or white. Even pictures inside weren't guaranteed as they came out completely dark most of the time. I just requested to return it to buy another one but upset I've gone through 30 film sets with the majority printing out ruined.
My daughter absolutely loves this camera! We got it for her for Christmas, the color is so pretty! It actually takes good quality pictures as well, the only downside is the film can be a bit pricey but besides that we love it!
Great gift for my Mom and sister. They love it. Thanks!
Can not say enough about this camera.  It brings back memories of the true polaroid camera.  The pictures come out so well.  Small enough to take anywhere, and the pictures develop instantly.
Santa sent this camera to my 5 yr old daughter. She figured out how to use it in minutes but I have to load the film. She's obsessed and uses it constantly for her artistic expression. Silly girl even took it to Walmart to capture her day.
I love this camera.  The film is sorta expensive but it's totally worth it.
I LOVE this polaroid camera. I have had this camera for almost a year and the memories captured are amazing. You always need to remember to have extra film when you are out and about to restock. It takes a few test shots to work the camera and know what setting to put it in. It recommends what setting to take a picture with so that suggestion is very helpful.
This camera was the worse purchase I have made in a very long time and my daughter was very disappointed. She was looking forward to document her Christmas break with this camera and could not!The camera turned on but all photos taken indoors where completely black and photos taken outside where so over exposed that they were white!  We thought it must have been the film so we took as many photos in as many different settings as we could to end the film and were hoping for a few good photos but no! The second film came out the same. After waisting $20 on film and have zero photos, I returned the camera. I love amazon for their easy exchange process. We are scared to order a new one but my daughter really wants one so we will try one more time!To me it feels that the exposure system was off and because it is automatic, even if you change its setting manually, the auto takes over. It thought it needed less light when it actually needed more and vice versa.I will update this review when I receive the new camera.
my little sister loves getting this camera for Christmas! it works well and the pictures look great!
small pictures, but accurate
These are awesome! Reminds of when I was a kid.  Anyway easy to use and my 10 year old loves it.
My daughter wanted this so bad for Christmas, so I got it for her. She loves it, but she's also a teenager. This is definitely not caught up to 2016 speed for electronics, but if you don't care about that, it's fun to play with.
I am in love with my Polaroid camera! It was really easy to use and the color looks amazing.
Love this camera! The pictures are small, but they always look great, and it's very easy to use. It's just a standard point-and-shoot camera that anyone can use, and there's a little ring around the lens that you can turn to put it at different lighting settings. The nice thing is that the camera recognizes your surroundings and has a light that tells you which setting is recommended. The pictures print out and develop within a minute, and I know you can buy different types of film with cute borders although I've only used the standard white so far.I have the camera sitting on my shelf when I'm not using it and it looks really cute, and I taped up some hemp cord and got little clothespins to display my pictures on the wall. Like I said, the pictures always turn out looking great simply because they're that "polaroid" style.
Flash works unclear. Many photos are spoiled.
The receiver of this gift has been using it daily since they got it!
Love it. Easy to use.
This is the CUTEST camera for a teenager. There's the instant gratification part because the pictures come out immediately. Mini pics that they can share with friends. The camera is cute and comes in different colors like this sweet pink. Price was right and film is not terribly expensive. Definitely nice when you don't want to go digital.
I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! It's so easy to use and I love how the pictures come out very vintage. The only downside is that the film is expensive.
I originally rated this as four stars but after a few more uses and wasted exposure, I needed to knock it. More than half the time, the film would be exposed for too long resulting in a too light picture. I gave it to a friend so I could be rid of it.  I recommend the instax wide camera.  I've never had a problem with the exposure of that camera.
Love this. It's super fun. I wish I'd had it for my best friend's bachelorette party. I had this great idea to make a little scrap book and have everyone write advice/jokes in it and put a picture of each person on the pages they wrote on. It was a GREAT idea. Six years later I STILL haven't printed the pictures I took. I SO wish I could have had this back then. It would have been PERFECTION!
I liked these fun funky colours!
My mother loves this Christmas gift!!!  Quality is that of polaroid pictures of our youth and that is totally fine!  Easy to operate and load with film.  Great gift idea!!
I am in love with this camera! It is so cute and super easy to use. I can't wait to take more pictures :).
LOOOOVVEEE
cute!
My daughter loved it for christmas
Shoot great photos. In love with it!
I love it takes great pictures
Granddaughter loves it
great
Great looking camera. The color is awesome. For the most part, the pictures develop as expected. I have had some issues with lighting affecting the quality of the picture. All in all, a fun camera.
Bought as a gift and it was exactly what my daughter wanted.  Make sure to buy a case, lots of film, and a coordinating photo album for the mini8 photos.
Works great and love it, lots of fun. Was a christmas present. The settings are a bit confusing but just playing around with it is all that's necessary. Awesome!
Very cute.  Easy to use.  Pictures are not great though.  Obviously, I didn't expect digital quality, but they are all really dark.  Fun for 9 year old daughter, but learned to take pics outside for better quality.  Note that these are not the same size pics as the old polaroid square ones.  These are much smaller.
I've had my camera for a good 5 months now and it works great. The battery life is great the photos are great everything works fine. Picture quality is cool and vintage but you have to remember if the lighting is too bright or too dark the picture won't come out too great. But you'll figure out what works best through trial and error. I took my camera on a trip to New York with me and it took wonderful pictures of the 911 memorial and new World Trade Center building but didn't take good pictures in the dimly lit museum of natural history. I would buy one again I this one ever broke
Such a fantastic product. Easy set up and instructions are simple to set up. Film must be purchased separately. The mini picture quality is excellent! I cannot wait to use my little memory photos for scrapbooking:)
Huge hit at the birthday party.  My daughter and her friends had a blast taking photos that "you can like have".  They shot up 2 packs of film the first day.  And now its sat on her shelf for three months.  It takes pretty poor, tiny, photos.
I am pretty disappointed in the fact in came in 3 days when I have prime, color is nothing like the picture online, it doesn't even come with batteries or film to test it out. Ughh
great!!
I love my new camera
We love this thing and it was a Christmas hit!CON: Didn't realize it didn't come with "film". Had to buy separate after Christmas but that my problem for not reading fine print.
Beautiful
I bought this as a christmas gift for my 14 year old sister and she absolutely loved it and said it was the best gift she's gotten (I won't lie, I loved it too). The shipping took longer than expected and arrived after christmas, but it was worth the wait. The picture quality is wonderful and perfect for capturing memories. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
love it
Great product. I am very happy with it. I would highly reccomend.
Great
This has quickly become my 14 year old's favorite play thing!  She carries it everywhere and is always taking pictures.  I still cannot believe that we are back to polaroid picture taking, but what a cute way to do it!  I do wish the film wasn't so expensive, but my daughter isn't complaining.
My niece uses it all the time! Her favorite Christmas gift.
I got it as a present for christmas from my parents. I picked the pink one put myself and they ordered it for me! It came on time and is amazing with pictures!! I love the Polaroid quality in all my pictures!!
My daughter loves this camera. It's super cute and easy to use.
Bought this as a present for my wife. she loves this camera. She has already used it on many parties including bachelorette party and for granmother's 80th birthday. She used the pictures for a scrapbook and it is a hit at every event.
Such an awesome camera! Was on the fence about buying it, so glad I did! It's prefect for vacations! Easy to use and film isn't too terribly expensive.
beautiful ..
It is a toy, but a lot of fun!
My 11 year old daughter got this for Christmas and LOVES it.  Her and her friends think it is simply amazing!
def sturdy, cute color, but it did not come with the film that it said it does!
Fast shipping, great product!
Love it just didn't come with a strap so that sucks
Fellas, get this for your girl. Be ready to smile. She will love it.
My daughter has had so much fun with this!  Seems to work well.
Purchased this camera for my wife who is a professional dslr photographer. She was super excited about it and still is. It is obviously very different from a dslr and has a learning curve with it, but overall she has enjoyed using it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a little fun with a Polaroid camera.
Getting film in and out of this camera is very difficult. Not like the exact camera I bought at Walmart. That was was much easier. I ordered this one because of the pink but wish I had ordered somewhere else :/
Bought as a gift for my niece, needless to say I am the best aunt in the world this year!
I love it !
Love it so much
My daughter asked for this camera for Christmas. A bit reluctant, I purchased it anyway. I'm disappointed in it though. The view finder doesn't line up with the actual lens, so trying to take a centered picture is a matter of guess work. The cost of the film isn't cheap either, so having to take multiple shots to get it right is pricy. I'd recommend checking out other cameras before getting set on this one.
My boyfriend and I take pictures with this constantly!  Since I bought it he's decided to order one of his own.  The pictures are adorable and so personal.  I think we often forget how sentimental we are; it's nice to be reminded of that.
Love this camera
SUCH a fun camera! The price is pretty comparable to Walmart at times, but still a great buy!
Just received it, tried it and it is working great!
Came packaged very well! Comes with batteries so that's a plus(:
The camera was ok... my daughter liked it, I realize that I should have bought a case because a strap does not come with it and it can fall easily. Also I was a little disappointed that the box and all instructions were not in English.
Works awesome daughter loves it. Fast delivery and packaging was good
Loved it
14 year old loves it, film is pricy but expected
I love this camera. Great for parties or family functions. Everybody loves this little thing and it's a nice and fun ice breaker.
My daughter loves it! A fun way to take old school pictures.
Great product!
Love this! I purchased this for my 7 year old and she is very stoked. The film is incredibly easy to load. Just open the back, line up the yellow marks on the camera and film, and lay it in. One button to turn on the camera, one to take the picture. Simple. The picture comes out fantastic. It does not work miracles, a dark room is not lit up by flash alone. There is a countdown window on the back of the camera that shows how many pics are left. Very helpful. The instant gratification of having a picture in hand is a happy kid maker. On a side note, I ordered the raspberry color, which is slightly more orangey than it is pink. It is not exactly the same as pictured. Very very happy with the camera!
I love using this camera for my art journals. It adds some "old school" feel but saves me tons of time because the pictures are instant. I don't have to remember to go print out the pictures I took. My nieces love my magic camera.
Great picture quality!
This was a Christmas gift that my daughter requested. She loves it.
I love it! The pictures are so tiny and cute. Perfect for making memories!
Beautiful camera, easy to use. Great gift for people of all ages!
It just came in and my girlfriend loves it already. Great to capture those perfect memories.
This is as fun a gift for my 13 year old niece, as it was when i got one at that age ftom my Auntie. The camera is sleek and i got it in white with a key lime case. It is more compact and the film is easier to load than the old Polaroid I had growing up. One notice, the photos are actually about 1/3 the size of the 80s version, but don't let that dissuade you, it's still a wonderful gadget. At about a buck a shot, it also teaches a teen about having budget, since they are so used to clicking 100s of pics with their digital.  Their piggy bank will be empty if they aren't thoughtful about what they shoot!! Best film price by far here on Amazon.
I bought this camera for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. It came in great condition and is stylish and cute. Takes beautiful pictures and its just great overall.  So far this camera is trouble-free. I guess our old time stuff are coming back in style lol
Nice camera.  Takes OK pics, but the film is ridiculous expensive.  $1 per pic taken.
I LOVE IT!!!!!
all perfect, delivery on time!
Purchased this for my daughter for her birthday to take pics of her one year old.  She loves it.  The flash can get annoying indoors, but outdoors it takes great photos.  Please remember these take very small pictures, but it is a fun thing to have, and you can purchase cute little photo albums to place the pictures in, or attach them to the inside of birthday cards and projects.  The film is not cheap, but it's a great little novelty.  The camera is adorable!
It was a birthday gift
My daughter absolutely loves this camera and was super excited about being able to snap a picture and it immediately printing. Ha! What a concept. :)
Love it
Nice camera. Daughter loves it
Great gift
So fun and cute!
Great
I ordered this for my daughter's 13th birthday.  She loves it!
Perfect for "that Polaroid" feel to the pictures. The eye hole is a little small to see out of & I don't like you can't turn off the flash.
