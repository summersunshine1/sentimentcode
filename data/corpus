Gave it to my sister in law and she loves it. Great for scrapbooking and selfies I guess.
pictures small
Excellent pictures!
Great camera for party photobooth, also a great learning camera for hobby photographers.The quality is so different from spoiled digital photographs, and we have to be more selective of what we shoot, but it has a nice authenticity and vintage feel to all the pictures. Loving it so far.
Fast delivery, low price. Great camera.
Daughter loves it, but film is a little pricey.
BUY THIS ON AMAZON. THEY ARE THE CHEAPEST HERE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS ANYWHERE ELSE.Perfect gift for anyone for christmas. I love it.
this is just perfect, great quality picture!
Price was standard and I was really disappointed that it did not have ANY film with it! Good thing that I ordered backup!
Gift for 8 year old grand-daughter, she loves it..  But film expensive so she is selective on pic she takes.
Item arrived quickly and as expected
Happy with the camera.
I love it  but this is a  gift
Its like a toy not a real camera.  Picture quality is so bad you can barely identify objects.  I purchased this believing it was like the old poloroid cameras and its nothing like it.  Its like a toy camera.  Very unhappy
Bought as gift for my ten yr old grand daughter.  She loves it. Her mom put film in for her and she was snapping pics like crazy.  Perfect tween gift.
Bought this for my daughter for her birthday....She loves it!
Love it!
I bring this when I visit friends, when I go to conventions, and to holiday parties, and everyone gets the hugest kick out of it. It's fantastic for creating instant mementos and everyone has a lot of fun taking photos.
Fad or trend my daughter was insistent about this as a Christmas present.
My daughter loves it, she finally found a hobby.
Very good quality pictures, very durable
this is a gift and my granddaughter will love it
Absolutely love this camera. Love the color and the cute caramel bag I got to protect it. I love the way the pictures turn out. Just have to make sure that the setting is switched for the lighting. I love having a physical print instantly.
This camera is so much fun! The film for it only comes with 10 photos per film pack I would by a couple off amazon they are way cheaper on here then walmart, or target! Such a fun gift for a tween she really is having so much fun taking pictures and having them right away
Perfect for parties and/or gifts!!!! Love it!
I LOVE this camera so much. I bring it to all my parties and people love it. The camera and case are a great buy, the film is where it can be a little expensive. Buy in bulk if you can. The pictures turn out great, but note that you won't get a picture like you would on your phone, as all the settings add a sort of "vintage" look to the pictures. You need to figure out the right setting as well, which might take you a couple photos to get. The only other thing is that sometimes the camera will turn on while it's in the case and might run down the batteries but I haven't had to replace them yet. Overall, LOVE this camera and it's a lot of fun.
Great product and fast shipping
Very easy to use. Great photos
great¡¡¡ the camera is fancy
This camera is loads of fun.
Came brand new and in perfect condition. It worked right away, and I absolutely loved it.
Good price
Fun,  This camera is Fun, Fun, a blast at parties to take quick little shots of friends  moments in time! Plus young kids think this camera  is really  something! Awesome gift!
My instruction manual is in Chinese ! I Don't know how to use my CAMERA! It looks just like the photo
Great gift idea.
it was a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it.
the box that holds the camera came completely opened. i can't even give this as a gift which is what i was planing on doing. I hope this camera works .
works as described
I got this for my daughter, and she loves it. The camera does a surprisingly good job. I bought some extra film so I can give it a try!
I really love my fuji camera.  I even got one for some friends as a gift.  I take it for camping trips in my 1970 VW bus to take pictures of people I meet along the way to remember them by.  I also take pictures of people I meet and give them the print.  It is a fun way to spread happiness.  My only wish would be that the film were more economical.  $1 per picture is pretty pricey.  I would use my camera more if the film wasn't so expensive.
This deal was amazing! Everything got to me in perfect conditions and i loved it, easy to set up with the film
It was exactly what I ordered! The camera itself works smoothly and is true to the color in the picture. 10/10
works great and a fun color
Great quality , came within a good time frame
It's so mice and comfortable to take pictures with. Super easy to use and a wonderful camera to display.
Great
Nice camera
I love this camera, the pictures are super adorable. It's easy to use, easy to load, and pretty durable.
So "cheap-y" like. Doesn't look like it's made to last. Very cheaply made. For what it does, it'd stick to your camera phone and just get a poloraid printer.
loved it, my wife is in love with this camera,
This was a gift for our 9 year old grand-daughter; she has had a lot of fun with it.
Got this little camera as a gift for my girlfriend and she used it all summer capturing cool pictures of her various adventures hiking or going to the beach.
Very cute
excellent
We can no longer use this, it's broken.  Do you offer repair?
My daughter is dying for this camera.  The product came in good condition and arrived on time.  I can't wait for her to open this gift, she's going to be so excited.
Bruh this s@$& is smashed
Looks red :(
Such a cute find for a cheap price! I've owned a couple of old polaroid cameras, and this has been the easiest to use. Very portable and fun!
Absolutely loved it! I used it for my wedding it was a hit everyone wanted to take a Polaroid picture
BEAUTIFUL!
cool..
Great quality. Better than pictures. Looks shophisticated
Nice to get printed pictures quick, love it!
Nice camera, easy to use!
Great
Used this for a Wedding guests book & sign in. It was Fun! Taped pictures in guest book.
This is a fun camera, the film is a little spendy but compared to other sites I used amazon had the best deal
good
I loveddddddd it!! I would so buy another one with a different color.
Shold have came with film
Pretty neat camera, very nice-looking pictures!
Great experience
It works no problem. It is what the description say it is. Its an awsome little camera and if you're not convinced search up video reviews on youtube, you won't regret.
Fun yellow color, works as explained in the description. Very easy to figure out. Note: The lighting has to be just right, or the photos will be very over exposed. Be sure to listen to the camera's "advice" on which lighting setting to choose. Otherwise, great product, fair price, and very entertaining for family gatherings -- for young and old alike!
Easy to use and fun picture taking!
Love it! Works great and arrived quickly. Be sure to use the right settings or else the photos can turn out too dark or too light.
My 9 year old daughter loves it.
It looks more pink in the picture, got it last night and its RED. and ugly red at that. Although my daughter wont care. I DO
It came damage. when you took a picture there was white dots all over tried replacing film and batteries but still didn't work.
A great gift for anyone!
great camera!
My girlfriend loves it
Absolutely looveee using my camera ! It takes great shots . I googled some about it and if you switch the settings sometimes you can get a better picture
awesome!
These cameras are SO much fun. Always a crowd pleaser and a great way to capture memories.
My daughter loved it ;)
Love to use to capture fun moments
Perfeita! amei!
excellent !
I love this camera. I received it as a birthday present. I don't use it as much as I would like but it takes great photos. Definitely pay close attention to the light settings on the front. Some pictures came out to bright due to being on the wrong setting.
I bought this Polaroid camera for my daughter for her bday ! She loved it . Works great. Easy to use & good quality pictures ,My daughter loved how big it was she could take it places & it wasn't too big.
Bought it a few months back, the settings have stopped working and you can no longer change modes.
Perfect
Really Nice shipping was fast! I'm not sure why they call it a mini because it is huge! Nice pastel blue as shown got the package deal with case and film twin pack! Christmas gift for my daughter she is going to love it!
Beautiful and works like a charm. Perfect condition!!
Camera works great! the pictures come out clear and take less than a minute to develop. My sister loves the color
I bought this for a makeshift photo booth at "Parents' Night Out" at our church.  We had kids from 1 to 12 years dress up and enjoy taking home a photo.  The camera was a blast for everyone & very easy to use!!  I would definitely buy this again & have told others how much we liked it!  The photo quality is as expected for instant film- just okay quality, but you are so excited about the photo & watching it develop it is lots of fun.  I did like having a flash on this camera for our indoor setting.I liked this enough that I want to buy this for my 10-year old niece now!
Love it, pictures are crisp and clear
Wow! This camera is awesome and so much fun! Easy to setup and use! Bought for my daughter's 13th birthday and she loves it!
I bought this as a Christmas Gift.  I'm sure she will love it.
Granddaughter loved it, she is age 11
the camera didn't work. i tried taking a photo but it wouldn't print correctly
Everithing perfect!
Thank you
I love this so much! It's easy to use and it works amazingly! I couldn't have asked for a better Polaroid myself! It's perfect for a teenager!
Brought as a gift this product arrived on time and was exactly as described
Great for kids and super cute. Decently priced as well
My niece love it. It a kid toy to be honest. Don't think you are getting a pro pic with this because it won't happen.
I just adore this camera. It is so cute and takes great little polaroids! Everyone loves the photos. The camera itself feels a little cheap and not very sturdy but it does what it is supposed to do at a great price point.
Got it for my mom last year for xmas & she loved it!!
Very cheaply made . This wont last long
Love it, gift
got this as a gift for my sister for her birthday. she loves it. arrived quickly and works perfectly.
Awesome camera!
Daughter loves it.
So far so good! The pictures came out fantastic!
I LOVE IT. Its really worth the price. My pictures come out great. I also love that there's no charging just batteries needed. Which come included !
Purchased this as a gift for my niece...she loves it!  Seems to be easy for young people to use, and they love seeing the results right away.
Purchased two for our engagement party. The price is great, but the button placement is completely opposite of other cameras. Had to design a How-To-Use sheet for the party as it's not user friendly.
Perfect for my teenage daughter.
Cute and vinatage, the Quality of the photos is beautiful! I take it out themeparks and everybody just looks at the cute little camera.
Perfect!
This camera is simple, cheap and fun. The lens is all plastic and you can't turn the flash off. Not manual controls at all.Each photo is like a hail mary, But there is not cheaper way to enter instant photography. It's a very fun experience and you don't need to carry around $600 cameras.
AMAZING !!!! VERRY FAST DELIVERY.the pakage is verry clouse .and the camera inside is protective.thank you .my daughter so verry happy this christmas.thanks.
This is awesome! I have so many cameras its crazy but this is fun for parties and easy for quick snap shots!
awesome
Would Highly Recommend!  Make sure you buy the extra film!
Purchased as a gift for my sister, she loves it so much. She had a blast taking pictures with her friends and creating a wall collage. Perfect Christmas / birthday gift. Instructions are very simple and camera is very easy to use. The only downside is the cost of film, however I think its definitely worth it, you can purchase film on amazon for a great price.
This camera is a great, relatively inexpensive way to get printed photos back in your life! Great for sticking them on the fridge or on your desk. Just remember these photos aren't the size of old poleroids. They are pretty tiny, but great, high-quality keepsakes.
I LOVE THIS CAMERA.
So happy with this camera I've been wanting it for a while and finally got it! Such a great price and product also shipped quick. Here's a tip though if it's really bright outside cover the flash. If not the picture comes out dark.
My daughter loves it!
Loved it
Purchased for my niece and she loves it..it's cute and small and easy to use..
Love it!
I bought this for my daughter as she wanted to go retro style in taking pictures.  But the photos are very small.  Not like a Polaroid from the 70s.  The camera is large and the photos are small.  It should be the opposite.  The camera does work if you put the film in correctly by reading the instructions.
The camera should measure the light automatically, but you have to select that in every photo… very stupid system.
Very nice camera, worked very well. Take vey nice pictures
Thx: as described, fast shipping, good paking
Good price, strong, and it does what my kid expected from it.
I love to hear my child say #FREEZE
super fun camera
Bought this for my 5 year old for our summer travels and he loved it. Felt like such a big boy with his own camera and it was cool to see him begin to develop an eye for framing a shot and just capturing images of the things that interested him. Fun to be able to take multiple photos with new friends and leave a photo in their hand when we said goodbye.
Super quick delivery,  excellent condition...Same color as shown in pictures....Thanks
Purchased this for my wife as a gift. My only complaint is that the raspberry color is more of an orange. It looks like a dark pink or a coral color in the picture but is definitely not one of these colors in person.
ITS PURPLE LIKE THE PICTURE.  ITS A XMAS GIFT SO HAVEN'T USED IT YET.
Bought as gift,  looks great
Since technology has taken over I'm sure anyone can agree for the most part we take pictures on our phones or otherwise. For me anyways, that was the case. All my sons pictures are in a computer on a hard drive etc. I am busy and never get to ordering prints or printing myself so I resort to looking back at my memories via phone. I honestly regret not buying one of these sooner. Any camera really. These are so easy to use. Reasonably priced. Easy to use. And I'm so excited to start filling scrap books of these. Instant photo prints. I'm so happy with my purchase and I'd truly would recommend this to anyone. Aside from my joy of it my son will thankfully know these types of pictures are possible he was amazed I couldn't just "delete" the bad pic haha treat yourself or a friend. A parent must have.
Bought this as a set with the case for my younger sister. She absolutely loves it, says it's the cutest thing. An excellent buy.
I never go my things this is the first time this happen to me I need my things are my money back
nice
great camera prefect birthday gift
She loves it.
Very happy. Christmas  gift. Came fast
I love my camera!!!!!
Nothing but absolute fun and gives ya a great sense of not constantly being on the phone. Polaroids are actually more fun.
Great price
My daughter loved it very much!
I love it! Perfect for anyone who has an interest in photography
It's a cute gadget but I was a bit disappointed in the size and quality of the photos.  Not the 'old' polaroids of yesteryear.
Daughter loved it
Fun little camera for get togethers with friends. The picture quality isn't that great. (Faces look washed out) but I'm satisfied for the price.
It came just as expected.
this was a perfect gift for my sister she loves it !
This camera is just awesome! I love it so much and the price it totally worth it. The whole style of the camera is amazing and simple. I love the vibrant colors and the sizes of the photos are perfect. Just beware everyone will want a picture so use your film wisely! Some things I wish it had was maybe a little compartment for the film (not sure how that would be designed or possible) and something to let you know how much battery it had left. I mean I could guess and just change them every so often, but that seems like a waste to me. It's also important how far you are away from taking the pictures because sometimes they come out really really dark if your far away. But it does tell you in the directions to stay close. I'm also a little confused on the photo settings and if they actually work, but I'm not a big camera person so I'm sure it's doing something I'm just not noticing a difference between settings. I would definitely recommend this camera! It also got to me very quickly which was awesome! I take this thing everywhere I go now :)
My Granddaughter loves it!
Really cool camera!  The white looks really nice.
Easy and fast printing! If ur lazy just like me on going to store jist to print preciouse pictures, buy this one
A++!
It is not seller's fault. It is Fujifilm's fault.Mini 8 is not good.
Awesome item
My daughter wanted this after a frien had one! Lots of fun she loves it
Fun little "Polaroid-style" camera
Great fun kid gift over age of 9 but very expensive for film
as expected
Love it
Great product
My dream item.
Perfect condition! love the blue color and its so easy to use. the directions in the box are a little weird and it took me a sec to figure out how to put incthe film, but it is so great!!
Absolutely love this little camera! It's easy to use and it takes decent pictures. Using it in a classroom for student celebrations and immediate printed pictures has added an "wow" factor.
Such a cute color and takes clear and cute photos!! Also, there are so many cute accesorries and cases for the mini 8! I got a cute case that i can also use to hold my wallet, phone, photos I have taken, and extra film.Case - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MGHSJ44/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1My friends and i buy the film in bulk for such good prices!60 sheets - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O4OR4GQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1100 sheets - https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Instant-Sheets-Pack/dp/B00G6C7XUG/ref=sr_1_7?s=photo&ie=UTF8&qid=1480874704&sr=1-7&keywords=fujifilm+instax+mini+8+film
My 9 year old son loves this.  And for the price I'm not worried if he's rough with it.  I got a protector case for it and strap.
For paranormal investigating you cant mess with a polariod
Divine
Used this camera for the selfie blows at my baby shower. Everyone loved it! The pictures are instant so the quality isn't as good as your phone of course, but an amazing upgrade from the throwback picture with the same nostalgic feel
Works great and I love the color
Got this as a present for my sister! Very cute and wonderful! I'm thinking of buying one for myself. Works great, instructions are a little confusing so just proceed slowly and cautiously when setting up for the first time. Is about the size of two fists, if not smaller.
Cannot turn on wifi,battery life is just an hour when fully charged,I can't send it back because I am going hone this week and I am working in ship ( pls check my shipping address),I ordered for my kid now I am going home with nothing,I trusted your product and I loss my money,and now I don't have time to order andi before my vacatio
I just realized this model is lower than a mini 25 which I owed so I returned it. If you have a mini 25 and wanna get a upgrade, don't buy this one. This should be the entry level. It has less function than mini 25.
My polaroid is amazing with great fast shipping and perfect instructions. Thanks!
Perfect
So much fun.....bought this for a birthday present for a male friend and it was the hit of the party.  Be sure to get lots of film!!
Worth every penny. The quality of the photos was great. And it's been a hit at every holiday party I've thrown so far.
Fast shipping works great.
Bought it as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. She constantly uses it to many holiday events, parties, and outings. I recommend buying one and recommend not opening the back if you know there is film because film estimates to a dollar each.
I brought this couple year ago, and this is still in great condition. I love to use it to capture the memories.
Kid loves it
Perfect
good
Great product! the photos have a great definition!
Unfortunately this camera did not work, had to send it back.
wonderful for capturing the candid moments in life
Beautiful
Lots of fun! We bought this and then a package of extra film and scrapbook as well as a case and a bunch of fun until you run out of film!
My daughter has had this camera for a day and already loves it! Hoping it's durable and can last her awhile. So far so good! I guess we will see in the future if it lives up to our expectations.
A gift for my daughter.  She loves it
Amazing camera!
Hello I just received my camera and film in the mail on Monday.. I took one photo that came out normal then the rest looked like this.. I was wondering if it is something with the camera, film or something I could have done! if anyone knows please let me know !!
So adorable. This really is a must have for everyone that likes cute things. I've seen so many people of different ages enjoy this! I can't get over the amazing color and it looks and feels like a toy which is not that bad because it works great but without the too delicate part. I recommend this to literally everyone.
It's so cute ! i was so happy ! the pictures came out lovely ! so glad i bought this!
Used for wedding guest book
My daughter loves this! Pretty easy to use, but make sure the correct settings are on before a picture is snapped so u don't waste a film. Film can be expensive. Love this tho!
Bought this for my wedding for my guest book, it worked perfectly! Everyone loved it and it was something different. Exactly as pictured and would 10/10 buy again.
Great gift for all ages.
Great camera, but "raspberry"  is not an accurate color discription. It's red.
Love these camera's! I have bought several as gifts for my kids and nieces and nephews. They are very easy to use and the pics are really cute. They have a vintage look that I love, reminds me of polaroids from when I was growing up. The only down side is that the film is expensive. Only 10 pictures per pack and unless you find it on sale can get really expensive, especially if your kids takes pics of every random person and thing. I have found the 2 packs on Amazon at a reasonable price, much cheaper than buying it at the store but I still need to remind the kids to ration their film. The camera works great, kid friendly and so far durable. It makes a great gift and the kids love them.
My daughter loves this and it's definitely a throw back to when I was little. Works great and came fast!
Getting used to the camera.It's cute.Small pictures, but, it's light weight andit's cute.
I used this to take pictures for my sisters bridal shower and it was a fun keep sake for people to take the pictures home afterwards.
I love it
Sold as bundle. Did not receive bundle. Received the camera without extra film package.
This camera is amazing! It was a huge hit at our reception and is very sturdy. It survived an excited young guest dropping it at a full run on the dance floor and still works perfectly!
Super like the camera and i order film they all work good together
Got it as a birthday gift for my sister she loves it!
This is a great, cheap camera.  I wish I could take more than 10 photos at a time, but it's not a deal breaker.  It's easy to use, easy to change out film, and the photos come out pretty nice!
Very nice
Why my granddaughter wanted this i will never know.  Pictures are very small and poor quality.
great for  partys and photo booth  party  film is a little pricey but good and unquie compare to the normal smart phone photoits more memorable with these photos then just another picture on your phonewife very happy with this  gift
Great
cute.
purchased as a gift and couldn't be happier! Arrived quickly and with all expected accessories.
I'm giving this product a two stars not because it's a bad camera but because of the condition it came in. It was dirty and when I tried cleaning the black smudges on the camera with rubbing alcohol they didn't come off.
Very satisfied with the packaging. Camera works well. Thank you!
Super excited to give this to my daughter. I know she is going to love it. I watched several videos of people that owned one and let me tell you it looked like they were having a blast sharing memories immediately with friends and family. thumbs up
It is a super fun camera...I got it as a gift for my 12 year old. Can't wait for her to open it. I love the color!
Awesome product my niece loves it she visit me for 1 week from PR she loved the price it came next day spent her vacation taking wonderful pictures she is very satisfied also surprised it came next day. Recommend either for self or gift. Don't forget the assesories like the carrying case and extra film.
This is a great camera! I purchased it for my 10 year old. We live in a world of instant gratification, and the camera fulfills that need! Instantly she has pictures. She received it for her birthday, at her party she took pictures with each of her friends, she gave one picture to the friend and kept one for herself. This was a cute way to send something home with her friends, but she also has the printed memory as well.It's very easy to use. Changing the film cartridge is also very easy, even my 10 year old can do it with no trouble.The pictures are good quality. They have a slightly muted color, but that gives it the vintage feel, which I think is the purpose.
I am absolutely in LOVE with this product! So very cute.
thank you
Excelente
works perfectly, bought this for my sister and she absolutely adores everything about it and has been wanting one forever!!
I love my pink Instax Mini!  And I'm not even a pink kinda girl!  So easy to use, and a lot of fun!  I've gifted a black one, a purple one (the grape color is fantastic!), and a blue one.
Camera has a nice matte feel to it! Very small and cute, easy to use. I love it!! <333
I thought I would love this but it stopped working after only one picture was taken. I feel ripped off and upset because now I will not have the camera I wanted in time for the holidays. I don't know why it stopped working, but the film will no longer come out of the camera and the only one that did did not develop. I also feel like I wasted my money on that film as I bought the camera and film as a package deal.
Great camera! Was a huge hit at our wedding. Quality of the polaroids was good
Very easy to use. My 11 yr old daughter absolutely loved it.
This was a birthday present and our grandson loved it....works great, took a lot of pic.
Is a gift for my 7year old, but the size and ease of use seem perfect. I'm certain she's going to love this.
14 year old girls loved it as holiday gifts
On time and good quality
This is awesome!! It actually came on the fourth day of the delivery instead of the 5-8 days in between. I really like it and my little sister will love it.
QUICK
Great camera! took me a while to figure out what setting to use to get the best lighting, but worth every penny.
Perfect
Came with no film.
nice pics for the value one day ill move up to polaroid.....but this totally works for now!!
Great camera loved it
There's something about having a physical copy of a picture that makes it 10 times better. These cameras are great for capturing special moments and getting a physical proof of that. Love them!
As expected
I'm so in love with this camera, i'd been wanting one for so long and I definitely don't regret this purchase! I've seen it at Urban Outfitters for $70-80 WITHOUT film, and I purchased here for $66 WITH 20 film + FREE same day shipping. Huge steal.
LOVE this camera!!!
So much fun. Fun fact: Amazon basics batteries do not work with this camera. Had to buy disposable ones. Also, the package I got didn't come with instructions or anything in the box except the camera and string. Be prepared to google instructions
love it
Best price, fast service
I bought this as a  gift for my girlfriend. She loves it. The picture come out very nice. Its just like he old school Polaroids but the pictures are half the size.
Love this camera and the color is so pretty. Takes excellent poloroid pictures!
Great item!
Cute little camera. The pictures are so cute in it's small frame. Love the vintage look & it's stylish. Small, therefore meaning portable and it doesnt bug to carry around.
This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and I'm sure she will love it.  I am curious as to why pink cost more than other colors, seems weird.Happy with delivery and the order.
I got this as a gift, I absolutely love it!!!! Definitely recommend for those small photos to decorate or keep for memories. One of my favorite gifts
Cool product.  Sometimes in bright sun, its hit or miss.  But all in all, the camera is alot of fun
Used this for my wedding guestbook... love how it all turned out...
Great quality and beautiful colod
I purchased one of these as a gift for my sister and had to get another for myself! Please be warned, this is a poloroid camera. It's very straight forward and you have to expect nothing more than face value. Don't expect or compare the picture quality to anything near new technology. But if you're looking for the poloroid style this won't dissapoint ! I purchased the pink one for myself and the colour is as pictured. It comes with batteries and is a easy to use and works quickly to produce a picture.
Just right
Great Product! Fast delivery! I'm very happy with this purchase!
my daughter loved it!
Great gift for my 12 year old niece!
It's a lot bigger than I thought. You have to take pictures up pretty close since they are so small. But, it is easy to use and comes out with some cute pictures!
Great for close up pics and attempted selfies. Need to test the flash options first before comitting to scenery.
Very fast shipping good price
So fun for my 9 year old and her friends. The film is a little pricey but it's great for parties and other occasions.
Bought it for my daughter. takes decent pictures. Sometimes the pictures come out a little too bright.
We were disappointed with the quality of the pictures.
Super fun to have.
Lovely colour and pretty light. Easy to use and no complicated instructions. It came with AA batteries too.
Amazing. Got this one for my sister and she couldn't be happier. Mine's Fujifilm instax 210 and obviously is a great experience to.
I was working great the stoped so I added new battery's and it wasn't the batter problem at all and I even bought a protection plan and they won't do anything about it
Great deal for this product- bought it as a gift for my friend and she loves it. Couldn't find it this cheaply priced anywhere else.
Great product good price
I love the camera, it's really cute and it takes really beautiful vintage pictures. My complaint is that it's hard to know what setting to put it on so it can take a nice picture. two of them were too bright, one was too dark. If any one can just help me understand the settings that would be great..it just really bums me out that I have to waste film because it won't take a good picture at times.
I REALLY love this camera it's just truly amazing and a very good price too.
I had purchased this item as an early Christmas gift for my girlfriend. She really enjoys it and has already gone through 2 packs of film in just 2 days. She really likes how it looks, one thing she just doesn't like doing is looking through the eye piece. It's not a big deal. It's not too heavy to carry around and with the case we purchased with it makes it even more easier to bring around and take quick shots on the go. I am very happy that she is extremely happy with the product.
I bought this camera to take fun pics on vacation, and I couldn't ask for something better! Our pics turned out great once we got the hang of the different light settings! I wouldn't recommend taking pics on SUPER sunny days, as our pics came out very light and washed out even on the full sun setting. I would like to note that if you are taking the film for this through airport security, it is recommended that you ask for a hand inspection because the x-ray machine could damage the film. I took all of the film out of the foil packs and placed them in a ziploc bag, and I didn't have any problems.
Love this camera!
Awesome camera
A dream come true <3 Absolutely adorable
My daughter loves this camera, Just like any other polaroid but in a smaller package as well as the film.
Small size
The pictures came out great. Super simple to use. I love mine. Don't second guess buying this, order it now!
For all of those particularly stuck in the past, and those who love the simpler things, this a perfect product for you. It brings a new feeling to the nostalgia of Polaroid cameras, and it has amazing quality! Definitely worth what it costs, and it wont disappoint. The film is somewhat expensive, but understandable. If you're interested in photography, vintage items, or anything in between, I would definitely tell you to consider this product!
The light settings about as fickle as my landlord is on being a good landlord (very fickle). Sometimes pictures turn out, sometimes they don't. Sometimes it auto adjusts, sometimes it doesn't.
For taking instant shots, it works fine. Photos aren't the sharpest in the world, but that's not why you buy one of these.
The pictures are so small you cannot see anything.  Not a good buy for me.
Love it! The yellow color is perfect as well, very pale just how I like it
I love this camera. It's a cool little thing to carry around that usually catches people's eyes because of its uniqueness. You should buy it and enjoy. Don't expect to become a professional photographer as this is usually for people who enjoy the little things in life or just like near things. I use mine all the time and have no complaints about it.
Color was not at all as expected. Picture looks pink and since it comes with a pink case I assumed it was as such. No, its as close as red as you can get.
Our granddaughter love it!!
My 12 year old  niece loved this so much!
Works great except for it developed yellow stains on the plastic. Cant be washed off
Nice
This is the best thing I have bought in a while. Totally worth it.
Perfect! Works amazing! No complaints! BUY HERE ITS A GREAT DEAL & A LOT CHEAPER THAN MOST STORES
Works just as advertised! Make sure to check your light settings before snapping a picture! Film is expensive and no sense in wasting film
Daughter loved it
This camera is awesome! Dont try to take photos with things such as a ferris wheel or christmas lights in the background because the background will just be pure black. :( Tried to use at Disneyland in front of the castle and it didnt work. Otherwise very satisfied
I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!!
I have no complaints,  and I'm very picky!  I love this camera, and people swoon over it when I pull it out.Very easy to use, and the pink is prettier in person than the picture shows.I was expecting it to be just duller than a soft pink,  like in the picture,  but it's not.
This is the second one I've purchased as a gift. Personally I use the Instax Mini 25, but this is a more popular model and is priced well. Everyone loves this, it will make you the life of the party.
Mine seemed like it was okay,  but the door to open to put film in was warped and let light in, ruining a lot of my photos 😣
Bought for my niece, she loves it and has had no problems!
My 9yr old loves this camera! Takes better pictures than I thought it would.
Love my camera! Have had it a little over a year with no problems!
Don't buy it
Super cool just the film for it is super expensive
Will use the camera at Christmas.  Looking forward to taking great pictures to share.
Works perfectly and I'm very happy with the pictures I'm getting.
Love this guy. Fun for all
Great camera came just as described
My wife loves it
My niece loved it. I gave her this camera for her birthday.
At least I enjoyed for 1 day, but I loved it.
Feels flimsy in your hand. Does what it is advertised to do.
Received in perfect shape and at a good price.
It works great, picture quality has that vintage look and feel. I have had this for a few months and it has held up well. The only down side is the cost of refills. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to just take some fun pictures to live in the moment :)
My daughter love it.
Love this camera! The pictures are super cool and vintage
Sent me a faulty camera. Thought it might be just the film that came with, but the camera itself makes most of my pictures come out pitch black. (even if the flash is adjusted)
The pictures are a little smaller than I thought
I am beyond in love with this Instant Camera. It takes good pictures. I got it as a present for my self and because I wanted to have instant pictures for the day of my wedding. Instead of paying for having a photo booth, I used this instead! It works great. Price was decent and the film can get to be pricy but all worth it. I simply love it.
I bought this for my 14 year old daughter for her birthday. She loves it and all of the accessories that came with it.
I'm so glad I got this for my daughter's birthday! Amazon's price is about half what the stores here are charging for this camera. It's a great little camera that is easy to use and the picture quality is pretty impressive considering the fact that it's an instant camera. Couldn't be happier.
This was a gift to my daughter.  She is having fun with her new found hobby!!
Good
Great product
bought this for my daughter, she loves it!
so fun
adorable!
image quality is very poor and dark
it have three circle dot (●) in the every photo....
This is great when you don't get to see family often and you can snap a quick pic! LOVE love love!
The picture quality is just okay. The flash either washes out the image or the background is blackened out. I had an old Polaroid back in the day and think it was better. But the kids got a kick out of it at the party so it was a good novel effect.
Perfect product and everything!
Apparently this is a super trendy/popular item for the teens and teen-adults out there. Got this for my sister and she went snapping away. Granted that the photos will probably hide in boxes forever, but she's putting this to use.
bought this for a friend and she loooooves it!
We bought this as a little fun stand at a wedding. All the guests took photos and had a fun time.
love the color
great
Great for making quick memories! Makes people focus when taking a picture since they know they only get one chance to get it right. I love this light blue by the way.
love it
It is a great camera and works as expected
For some reason the pictures don't come out very clear but for the low cost it is overall a good product.
Luv it!  Bought this for me extensive shoe collection...  Now I know what shoes r in every shoe box in my closet...
It's so awesome I love this but film is so expensive
Love this camara! It's hard to use though. Make sure you pay attention to the kind of lighting if you don't want to waste a bunch of expensive film.
great, love it.
Great over all. Don't really like the fact that it looks like it's night time when I take pictures during the day.
I love it, so adorable
A seven year old girl's birthday present. She loves it of course, is framing her shots and making an album.
Great product. Excelent service and fast shipping!! Very Satisfied!!
fun and easy to use.  perfect for the going away party we had.
Loved it
good
I love everything about this camera the cokor, the size and especially the shipping! I didn't pay for shipping just the free standard and i ordered it on saturday and it got here on monday! AMAZING
Got this for a gift. Once they have opened it up I will leave a detailed review.
While I love my Mini 8, it can be hard to get an idea on how to properly use it, and testing it is really expensive because you need to buy the film so you need to 1. Learn how to use it really fast (or buy a lot of film) 2. Understand its options before taking your first photo 3. It forces you to consider your photos instead of just randomly taking tons of photos.
IT IS THE SECOND CAMARA THAT I HAVE TO SENT BACK. EVERYTIME THAT I CHANGE THE SWITCH TO USE EVERY DIFFERENT LENTS THE LIGHT DOES NOT WORK.... :/
Just as described and super fast shipping!!!! A++++++
Daughter loves this!
I got this in the mail on November 13, 2016. I messed with it last night, but it feels super cheap. You have to put the printed photo in a dark place so it comes out. If I were to take this outside in the day time, the film wouldn't develop. So far, this is super over priced. I wouldn't re purchase . It is a good idea though. Just kind of a lot of money for a cheaply made toy.
My daughter loves it. Great gift for a 10 to 12 yrs old.
it's really good! I love the blue one
Bought this camera for my grandkids and it provides hours of fun they take selfies and pics of their friends and hang them in their room with close pins.  Great fun for the price.
Love it!!!
Thank you! Love it!
Fun to use
bought this camara for my daughter's 14 bday.. she has not stopped using especially when she is with her friends..take awesome pictures
Bought for my sister. She loves it! Sometimes hard to get picture to come out clear. Some pictures come out all white or all black, even with the correct setting. She is 11 though so she loves the camera.
Awesome item for weddings and impromptu pics with friends.
Bought for a wedding photo guestbook, super easy to use, looks great and makes really nice looking photos. The printing and developing film is really quick too. Ordering a second one just in case of any breaks on the day.... for $50 seems like a great deal!
My husband and I got this for my daughter's birthday, and all her friends wanted one. It was a big hit and works get, easy to put film in.
I had to return because I feel is not good quality. Fun but not so fun when pictures come out in black.
Negative 5 stars!!!! 😡Extremely disappointed.  Purchased this item for a surprise anniversary party. We also purchased a props, backdrop and stand, for a fun selfie station so guests could take a fun selfie. Write a nice note and immediately paste the pic in the scrapbook. Itvwas gonna be awesome. It wasn't.  Why? Because, either this camera is garbage or we were sent a dud. Not acceptable either way, because we can't get those moments back. We tried a plethora of test shots with different lighting, different settings, etc. All to no avail.  They all came out dark and terrible. Very very very disappointed.  I love AMAZON, but this one hurt my heart. Please do better. I do NOT recommend this item.
So perfect ! I bought it for my wedding and it honestly couldn't have been easier to use and play with. I purchased this with the big box of film and it was way more than enough and totally worth the price !
Greate camera. Bought this as a preset to my sister and she loved it!
These cameras has really good reviews, so I purchased a little more easily. The camera is well worth it the money, it takes great pictures and works amazingly.
Camera didn't work right from day one out of 100 pictures take only 12 came out right the rest was just black
We bought the camera and Fuji film paper and the pictures do not develop!! Of course I don't know if it is a problem with the paper or the camera but it is extremely disappointing to my daughter who saved her money for a long time to purchase these items.
This is how my camera of just a couple months takes pictures now! Smh
I bought this for my wife and she instantly fell in love with it, we have photos from the mountains in Nevada & Arizona, Las Vegas and California... It's compacted and fun to use...
I love the color !!! so easy to use
I LOVE THIS CAMERA!
It is a typical instant camera - photos are on the small side - doesn't do to well in lower natural  light conditions - but depending on the price you get it for. -it's a fun camera to have around. Film is expensive  though
My granddaughter ordered this for her birthday!  She loved it!  Good color and cute little sized pictures.  Looks like a better size for scrapbooking.
So cute and works well
So instead of a guest book where everybody can write something we created a photo album. The pictures are credit card size and might not be as good as from your professional camera, but they are so unique. If you just have one shot to get it right, you put more determination in your pictures.The pictures will turn out better the more light you have. Yes, you do have a flash and some settings, but the key is light!
It's very cute I got it as a graduation present for my cousin and she loved. It takes pretty good pictures and has already survived a few drops.
Best gift i had ever bought.Great quality. Easy to use
Originally was looking for a digital camera but since I have been noticing these around more often among my college friends I decided to give it a go. And boy was it a good idea, I love it! It's beautiful, the right size and does all that is needed to do. It's simple yet chic. I love bringing back the old way we took photos and yet with a modern twist. Yes this camera is no digital, no does it not have any ports to "download" the picture, and you don't have to replace any ink. It's just simple. And I can express it anymore of how I would buy it again for someone else. It came fast and packaged well. This is a product that you would buy when you need to "treat yourself" :) .
love it
Works amazing
I love this little camera. I seriously love it. It's one of my favorite purchases ever.
I love this camera, is easy to use.
LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE PICTURES AND WORKS GREAT !!
Love this! So cute and super fun!
Perfect size. Easy to use and the mini films are fun size.
MY first polaroid camera and I was instantly in love. I love the fact that pictures develop right on the spot and i can change the settings depending on where I am.
Such a fun camera. Pictures are good quality outside, with lots of light. Indoor photos turn out pretty dark. Easy to use, definitely worth it.
To be honest I was really excited about this product but even with the settings for taking pictures in different envionrments my photos always came out blurry or dark - really sad it didn't work out!
Perfect ! I loved it!
Great purchase. I bought this camera for my sister's birthday hoping it was a solid Polaroid with a modern touch. It's functional, stylish and prints out great quality photos. It even came with a matching carrying case which was a nice bonus. All in all I'm happy with the product and definitely recommend.
so cool, and easy to work!
Such a fun camera for a party! Pics aren't the greatest, but it's like what you expect from the old school Polaroids- I call it "baby-roids"!
Great for parties. I use it all the time.
Always wanted this camera! I love it.
it was a bit hard to understand which setting to use was better until i figured out the light showed what was the best setting for now. I like the weight of the camera too and its super adorable!
It's just like the picture.  I love it.
Like it soooo much...
Super cute ! I've used it since the day it came in the mail. Not difficult to set up, batteries are provided (thanks), and perfect size - not too big/or small.
Great!
just what i needed for my camera
These cameras are amazing!!
gifted this to a friend. she loves taking happy snaps!
bought one for myself and one as a gift. both loved it to travel with.
Best purchase ever! This camera was a huge hit at my sister's wedding! We're going to use it for my wedding at a photo booth station. I love it!!
This is the cutest little camera. I love to take this on vacations with me. The Polaroids are smaller than traditional size. Great gift!
Absolutely love this camera ! It was everything I hoped & the pictures come out beautiful !
Great camera for my kids! They love polaroids
Bought this for a friend. It is basically a toy camera, but she loves it. The prints are quite small. Be sure to adjust the exposure dial manually, or your images will be useless.
AAAHHH-MAZING camera made very well and the pictures come out in seconds it's a wonderful little camera to have got it for my daughter but I enjoy using it too !
it was perfect
This is such a fun camera. It not only captures one of a kind pixes, but it it such a conversation ice-breaker (the pink color may be the initial eye-catcher).  Besides, I am soooo old school and using this camera is nostalgic, and giving some pixes now and then to random people is heart-warming  and is accompanied by smiles galore.
This camera works great not one complaint.  I do wish that the pictures were a little larger but the quality of the pictures was great.  I used it as a photo booth guest book for a birthday party it was a big hit.
It was my daughter's 9 bday present. It couldn't be a better present. Since then she has been taking pictures al the time with her friends, brother and us.My nephew (11yo) just saw it and have asked for it as xmas present.
This came in great same and I love it!! It takes such good pictures
Very very good
I love this camera! The old fashioned polaroids bring back the nostalgic memories of my childhood. There is just something about having a physical photo in your hand right away that is just so magical. Every trip or anywhere I go I take this with me in addition to my DSLR. The physical aspect is just great, especially to give away to friends or family, etc. The quality is quite good, depending on how you take the photo. It can be a bit too bright sometimes in broad daylight, even at the lowest settings however. But otherwise, the flash is decent during indoor photos when it can be a bit dark.
My Family loves it !
My granddaughter loves it
I've only had it for like 18 hours but I love it. Pics come out pretty clear. Gotta be careful with lighting. If it's too bright the film will just be white. But that's how Polaroid cameras are.
My daughter loved getting this camera from me for her birthday.  It's adorable.  The pictures are credit card size and what you'd expect in quality.  Definitely a great gift.
This camera is so cute! And love the fact that the camera it self is pretty inexpensive, however the film is kind of costly. But hey at least there is film for it. It's hard to find film for the old school Polaroids (my husband has on of those and he would know!).
Perfect for what we needed! Used it as part of our guest book for our wedding. Everyone seemed to be able to figure out how to change the film and use the camera without any instruction. Pictures turned out great from during the day and night!
I gave this to my daughter for her 10th birthday--she loved taking pictures of all her friends at her party and the girls got to see the photos right away.  Also the price on Amazon is MUCH better than out in the stores.
This a perfect gift for a teen, brought this for myself to try it out, planning on buying another one for my 16 year old granddaugher for her 16th. birthday.
Very new and good to use.
Love them!
I bought this camera for my daughter and she has enjoyed it tremendously. It is very easy and fun to use and take places. The price was very reasonable compared to other stores I had looked at.
Works perfect :3
Absolutely love this little camera! SO fun
Love, love, love...a hit at my wedding reception.
While this camera can be a little bulky, it's a lot of fun. It reminds me of taking Polaroids as a kid.The images are about as small as a credit card, so they can easily be stored in a wallet or in a change purse. The image quality isn't super fantastic (it's a lot like older Polaroids), but it's more for fun than anything. I'm considering using this at my wedding as a guest book. The film is about $1 a picture or $0.50 depending on how cheap you can get it, so I wouldn't suggest it if you blow through film a lot because it can be costly.Overall, I enjoy it. It was just what I was looking for.
This polaroid-type camera is my go-to gift for those i love, and they jump for joy. it's appealing, available in several candy colors, and unusual--a throwback that's totally new. i also give the plastic tiny colored clothespins and a string to hang the photos as they dry, ready to show off at a party or at home. it's not for great photos...it's for fun.
Raspberry is not true to color! Don't be deceived by the photo that they show. It's more of an orange tint/coral/burnt red. That's too bad, false advertising. The camera feels light and cheap, you have to push the lense back in with your fingers. After adding batteries and film it may feel more sturdy. It's a cute concept and price is unbeatable for an instant film camera.
Great product.  Price is good.
Fun! Spits out teeny tiny photos like Polaroid.  Pretty good quality for such an inexpensive camera.  Fun with groups and parties.
Bought as a Wedding gift. Crazy cute.
Its great
I'm really disappointed about this product. It doesnt work well like I expect
Great portable camera brings me back to the old days of instant photography. However, Fuji has master this technology bringing excellent quality on every shot. I'm really impress with the consistentcy of colors and light revealed on every take.
I love this camera but you cant get pictures at night or in darkish places.
This was so fun for my wedding reception! Love, love love! Would highly recommend.
Great camera in terms of "fun" but the pictures do get washed out if you dont have the flash settings on the right way
Love it !!
i freakin love this thing!! i think it is extremely helpful that the camera suggests which setting to use based on lighting. super easy!
It was shipped to me on time and in good condition. It has all of its parts and the box did not seem roughed up or tampered with. The only problem is that the camera does not eve work. which is a HUGE problem. I thought at first, maybe it is just the batteries that came with and that they were just dead. I promptly replaced them and, to no prevail, the camera was still broken. Really upset that it came to me broken and was very upset to find this out while on vacation. I took pictures with my phone rather than my new camera, which was a bummer since i was super excited about my new camera. Really wish the other reviews about the camera not working wouldn't happen to me, but it did.
Great camera - purchased for a teenage girl - she loves it.
It looks cool, but quality the camera itself it not good. I had mini 25 before and my friend had mini50. I buy this for a friend, and I hope there is no other problems. I would recommend paying a littler more to buy a better one.
I love it so much! It's easy to use!
Such an adorable camera, got it in pink and I couldn't be happier.
Picture is smaller than I thought it would be, but not bad. Color and feel are good.
Great gift for a teenager! Arrived nicely packaged and works great!
I love my Fujifilm insta mini 8! It is so easy and came with batteries! I only gave it 4 stars bc most of the directions were in a different language except for a small part. I ended up having to look up how to insert film and work it on YouTube.
Was a lot of fun at the reunion.  Thanks!
My daughter absolutely loves her camera , we used it for a party and had so much fun
Very satisfied.
Works great. Easy to use.
Great fun for the grandchildren! Very entertaining for the older kids. All 4 of my grand-daughters (ages 9,11,11, and 12) loved it. I do suggest buying extra film and maybe some accessories to add a little more fun things to do with the camera and pictures. I think you definitely need a case for the camera especially with kids being a little rambunctious. The only negative thing is the quality of the pictures is not as good as I think it could be, but still a lot of fun.
AAA
Totally fun camera!
Perfect tween gift.
good
This camera is a huge hit in our household!
This camera is so much fun! Easy set up...like 5 minutes. Photos came out clear and with a "natural" filter. Looking forward to snapping tons of shots!
I've ordered 2 for granddaughters and they both loved it!!!
Thank you!  My 10 year old is going to LOVE this camera for her birthday!!  Thanks for sending ON TIME!
Love this camera!  Although it takes much better pictures indoors than in bright sunlight, it's so perfect for instant photos and is exactly what I needed.
Photo quality beloe expectations
very great birthday gift for myself love taking pictures and how this camera takes them just absolutely love it would buy it again for someone to have
Wish It came with the film. Otherwise, its great.
If you're old enough, you remember using a Polaroid camera. This blast from the past is similar with a few differences. First, the picture size is a rectangle instead of a square and that rectangle is only a little more than half the size of the classic Polaroid square prints. Think business card size for these prints. Also, the resolution leaves a lot to be desired. It's not as sharp as the old Polaroids. If you know the old Polaroids, you know there wasn't room for a decrease in resolution.The film doesn't have the extra layer over it like those old Polaroids. Remember how you used to have to wait two minutes before peeling off the developer layer? Not with this film. You get to watch the image slowly appear over that two minutes or so. Speaking of the film, it's pricey. A two pack of 10 prints per pack costs about $10 from Amazon. That works out to around fifty cents a picture. Like I said, pricey.All in all, this is an expensive toy camera. Like my title said, this camera takes good pictures about as well as an Easy Bake Oven baked a decent cake. Of course, if you know someone who really is enamored with idea of this type of camera, you're going to be stuck getting one, so save your money as much as possible and get this one.
Great camera, daughter loves it :)
camera was defective
Good product
What am I doing wrong?! Film is loaded it snaps pic but doesn't print....???
:)
This camera is so amazing. I love taking pictures and this is great for collecting memories.
Perfect for a photo booth addition to a party. It was a big hit
Perfect camera ''''
It's so cute and nice. I love it :)
This camera is so fun. Great quality of the pictures too! Easy to take it anywhere. It has different modes for pictures, only thing is, no matter where you are the flash will always come out, you cant disable it.
Love love love this camera! Cute and adorable!
Product arrived in a timely fashion and is as described.
I LOVE ITTTT BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVER
Great value
Bought this product as a bridesmaids gift. Great Price, packaging was great! Show the camera on the front!This product is awesome to use and prints in great time. I love these cameras! Doesn't come with film - just FYI.
Purchased it as a gift for my older sister and she loved it! The camera takes great pictures and would highly recommend it to anyone. I will actually buying another one for myself
Thank you!
got on time as promised thank you
Good
So cute!!
I love this camera, and it arrived super fast!
Awesome. great quality
Love it
They had so much fun snapping photos!! You do have to buy a lot of film but they enjoyed the results.
I used to have a mini 7 before and it was easy to use. So I decided to by an 8 because of the attractive raspberry color. But it pissed me off somehow. How ever hard I try, the color of the pictures I took is either too dark or too light. The pictures look quite vintage but sometimes I need to show how colorful the life is, but I can't. I try to adjust the light but there is no use. Any helpful tips?
I feel like I went back in time. :) but love the instant convenience of having a photo
Pretty good little camera!  We used it at a party and people loved it.  The pictures print smaller than the old Polaroids that I grew up with, but the camera served it's purpose!
Great camera! Love the fact that you can capture the moment! Super cute and vintage! Good quality photos:)
Absolutely Love my Camera!!  Best purchase every.
Cute camera, still working to get used to it so my pics turn out not so washed out.
My granddaughters are going to be so happy on Christmas
This is a birthday gift to my 10yr old daughter.  We all love it so much and already took some pictures.  It is not as clear as the normal ones.  But the convenience and fun to take is totally worth it.
Instructions all in chinese, and no film included.
It's already broken and I didn't even buy it a long time ago...
My preteen girl LOVES this.  I  thought it may be something that she wasted a lot of film on, however she didn't. She's pretty frugal about what she takes pictures of. Not sure everyone's child will be that way but mine was. It give really cute pictures.
I take pictures all the time. It's the best.
Excelent
Great condition very nice my daughter loved it
Fast delivery & received exactly what was described. Love this product wish I bought it sooner!
This is actually a Christmas gift for my daughter. I'm rating in a 4 star based off of what others rated it. I opened it, I'ts heavier and bigger than I expected. It looks like it a good quality camera. I'll update after she uses it a few time.
This is awesome!!!!!
My daughter loves her camera, just what she wanted
Takes horrible pictures, sorry I listened to reviews
I love my camera.
This reminds me of the old SX 70 camera, only cuter!
too soon to tell, used only once
I love my fujifilm camera. It worked out great for a birthday party. Everyone loved it and the photos that they got to take home.
very good product!!! A+++
As expected!
I love this camera. I love it. So Much. Have I mentioned I love it? This thing is the most awesome little fun device. I had it a while, took it on vacation and got some really fun keepsake pictures... but the BEST part about this camera is that I used it for my wedding as the "guestbook" where guests would take selfies and post them in a scrapbook. IT WAS A HUGEEEE HIT! Everyone was raving about the little camera and photos and we got some amazing shots. I would recommend this camera hands down.
Does not take photos Junk!
Love my camera. fast shipping
Very easy to use and great price. It's fun to use waiting to see what the image looks like.
This camera is very cute, works great, and I'm definetly gonna be using it all the time.
Great photos and we had lots of fun taking them too.
Super cute and takes surprisingly good photos!
Fun camera
great price, saw this same camera at local craft store for double what I paid on Amazon. love the raspberry color!
Was a perfect accent for my best friend bridal shower, but be warned, and take special attention weather and settings or else the pictures will not come out as planned
LOVE this product
Love these cameras!! Easy to use I bought one for my 10 year old, 7 year old and 9 year old niece and they all love it.
Colour as pic, small and cute. Haven't used as yet though
This camera works great and is very easy to use! Instructions were super helpful and explained things great! I love the vivid color of the camera and the quality of the pictures !
terrible cámara.  Very blurry pictures.
My six year old niece loved using this camera to take photos. Small size was perfect for her.
Sucks that the film is expensive but the camera is the perfect gift for that special someone.
perfect
I'll update this review when I actually get a camera that works. After doing some research it is common for these camera's not to turn on. I had to order a replacement, let's hope it comes in time for the event I ordered it for... Currently not a huge fan, but maybe if I get one that works, I can update this.
It cute and very adorable and even came with batteries! I bought this with a case (much lighter case color though) and a twin film pack!! It came two weeks early I'm super excited!!! I kinda dropped the box out of excitement 😝
It was exactly as described, my kids have enjoyed it so much we had to order a second one.
After having a Fujifilm Instax for several years, I decided to gift one to my sister-in-law for her birthday. She was absolutely delighted and I was pleasantly surprised to see all of the updates the newer generation has. It allows you a little more control with your differently lighting settings and it's nice how the front lens pops out and you can just push it back in. The one thing I have to say that is nice on my version that hers didn't have was the little selfie mirror on the front when no one else is around to take your photo. Overall, a quality product. I used both my camera and hers at our wedding reception to help fill our guest book with impromptu photos. It turned out to be one of the things I've cherished most after the big day.
Perfect size for our 4 year old who loves to take pictures.  She loves carrying it with her everywhere she goes.  It's easy to use and takes great instant pictures.
Works well! Very happy with the purchase.
Product is not working at all, we review with an expert and it seems that it is damage and can not be fixed
Looks more purple and less blue in real life. Pretty though
awsome gift for my 6 year old. She loves it! she used it to take pictures of her friends on her birthday and give them the instant photos.This is also a useful camera. I wanted to take passport pictures and i used it to take the pictures and cut it out to right size. Saved myself a trip to a store.
Such a fun and cute camera for parties. My daughter loves it!!
My 17 year old daughter and budding photographer has been eying these since they came out and we finally got her one. She really enjoys taking and displaying the "hipster" pictures. The film is a little high but it is a novelty item.
Bought camera as a gift for a little girl's 10th birthday party. It was a hit! Girls had a lot of fun taking selfies and pics! :)
more red than pictured
This item was a quality item, ,worked well for my purposes.
Cute and easy to use. Took me half a dozen times to get the pictures right, but after that it's been a blast! I would not recommend it to be used outside as I never succeeded with photos taken outdoor with this camera. Indoor photos are quite good. Also, the actual picture features the center area of what you see in the viewfinder, so what you see will not be what you have. Also, this camera is not good for close-up shots as the instruction mentions. Make sure you keep the minimum distance away from your target object. But after one get used to it, there should be no problem.Replacing film is also very easy, more like a no-brainer.I've had mine for 2.5 years now, and I am excited to record more life moments with it!
The film is TOO EXPENSIVE so we returned this.
Very fun purchase. Not the greatest camera but also not too expensive. I'm going to be using this at my wedding to take pictures of all the guests.
Amazing Camera, works perfectly.
Great Camera !!!
I love it! The pictures come out great!
One word: PERFECTION!!  When i had my daughter i wish i knew about this camera. I love the picture quality. This vintage look and feel. I really love that i can hold a picture in my hand instead of looking at it on my phone or pc. It really captures those special moments.
I LOVE IT.
Yes
I bought this for my daughter's birthday it is a great camera the Polaroids are small but they are cute and something my daughter enjoyed so much as she love's taking pictures i would recommend other's buy this for their teen aged child or for their selves as well because i had wanted one right after .
Product is really bad. It worked only for 25 days and after in broke down, I tried to return it but the return  window had already expired.Really bad quality. (Really bad warranty)Don't buy
awesome camera
It's cute, I wish the photos were bigger though
We bought this as a birthday gift for a 7 year old. She was obsessed with these at a recent wedding and we thought it might be fun. Not only is it adorable, but it's not digital. NOT DIGITAL. It's amazing the quality that these types of cameras still produce, she has great fun with it, and it's teaching her a lot about photography. Not to mention... her birthday party photo booth = total blast. Highly recommend.
She loves it!
Love love love it
love
I fell in love with this camera the minute I saw I tI was looking for a onestep Polaroid camera when I came over this cute fujifilmI would recommend this for all ages and as well as for a gift i  guarantee the person  receiving this fujifilm will be thrilled ones they take their first Polaroid pictureSo I recommend too all you won't regret buying this fujifilm for yourself or as a gift
This was a gift for a young girl.  Tons of fun!  Be sure to include film and necessary batteries.
This is more of a toy than a camera, it worked well for about a month until the indoors/bright/cloudy/hi key function around around the lens started malfunctioning. It took almost another month for the entire machine to stop working. Also it has no real functions like exposure/zoom/flash optional etc. I wish I didn't buy so much film for this toy, I was looking for a camera. And of course, no warranty on a made in China knockoff.
Exactly as photo described, great seller thanks
Love it .!
I can't say how much I love this thing! I wish there was a better manual out there to explain the flash and such.
bought it for my grandchild who loved it
Fun camera for a party picture taking
Perfect!!!!
My girls love this camera, they love the fact that it prints out instantly. Overall, I am happy with this purchase. The camera does have a learning curve, though, trying to get the right settings so the picture turns out good. I wasted several pictures because the settings weren't quite right, which is a little frustrating because the cost of the film. The pictures also come out looking like they were taken at a farther distance. When the settings are right, I love how the pictures look, they look very vintage. I hope that with some practice, we can learn which settings work for what. The girls loved taking it to the zoo, every other kid was looking at them, like wow, that camera is cool, wish I had one! This seller had the best price, and the shipping was very quick. Would definitely recommend this product and seller, just be patient, it does have a slight learning curve!
I bought this camera to take polaroid photos at my friend's wedding. It was so fun being able to take pictures and hand them out to other guests immediately. The camera is so cute, and it takes really great quality photos!
Ordered two for wedding guestbook - they were a hit! My family fought over who was going to get to keep them after the wedding. Of course I had to let one go on the honeymoon :)
Exactly as described and the kids love them. They are very easy to work great teen gift as well
So fun and cute! It's perfect for my 8 & 10 year old daughter's. I got one for each of them on their bdays. They love them! I think they're fun for any age though. Even I want one and I have a 70d Canon with all the bells & whistles. This camera is just fun and takes great pics! Adorable little  keepsakes! Thank you!
My daughter loves it ✌✌
Very, Very Nice
I am a photographer, and got this along with a case for my 7 year old. She adores this camera. Film is pretty expensive at stores so definitely make sure to buy the film on Amazon.. it's the cheapest place I've found.
Great
Amazing Fun Filled Camera!  This is so much fun.  I bought it for my daughter, but the whole family has enjoyed it.  It is well made and has major Polaroid childhood nostalgia.  I absolutely recommend this camera.
This was a birthday present for my little girl, she loves it. It's a pretty cool camera. I'd recommend it.
Loving this camera 💙💙
I've had this for a week and so far it's worked very well. The lighting takes a little to get used to manipulating correctly, but aside from that I love it.
It is a very fun and easy to use product. I like how it resets the flash settings when you turn it off (although that takes a while to get used to). Just be mindful that the flash is very bright. Very bright and harsh.It's a fun little toy and if you don't mind that the film is almost a dollar a piece you will love it.The things you have to remember is that the film has to be completely excluded from the light for three minutes (otherwise the film will not fully colorize and that can be frustrating) and always check your photo settings (or the picture might be set on indoor setting when you are outside in the sun)!
Cool stuff 😊 Guests had lots of fun with these on our wedding day
It met all my expectations. The picture is clear and the price awesome.
Great deal!
I LOVE this camera, is amazing to see something from so long ago come back and now I can hand it down to my kids for them to enjoy. Having something simple as a picture to preserve for a life time means so much to me, it's easy to loose so many photos no matter what program you use to store them. LOVE LOVE LOVE it! The blue of the camera is very baby blue, the features to adjust the "type" of photo is the best part of this camera, it allows you to have different photos based on lighting. The fact that you don't have to "fan" the photo is another nice quality of these cameras.
LOVR LOVE LOVE IT!!I'm all for taking polaroid pictures, and this fits right in my bag.  Sometimes the pics come out a little darker on tone than you would think (accentuated shadows) but otherwise their good quality photos.  Just don't stand too far away from your subject because it'll come out to be kinda small.  Like if you'd zoomed out on the pic as you were taking it.
Such a cute camera. Loveee!The pictures are a bit smaller than expected, and the quality photo is definitely vintage. The photo cartridges are expensive to refill. But I still loveee this camera.
This item was a gift for my daughter and she loved it and continue to share it with her friends
Son loves it! And he's glad I didn't get the pink one! har har
Everything is great, it's exactly what my daughter wanted
I did quite a bit of research into current polaroid cameras before finally deciding on the Instamax 8. If you're looking for a affordable entry into the polaroid scene, this product is for you.If you're curious about polaroid photos and want that instant feeling of excitement when your photograph is printed in front of you, this camera is for you. Sure you could pick up an older polaroid camera but the price per photo if you purchase the Impossible Project film would be nearly $3 per photo. With the Instax and the instax film, you're getting photos for 50 cents a print. Granted the instax photos don't have the same distortion or print size as the impossible project film, but you still get the satisfaction of a polaroid product.Unfortunately the flash for the camera cannot be switched off. You can remedy this by purchasing some white or black electric tape to lay over the flash. Furthermore the viewfinder is less than accurate up close, so in some circumstances you're better off judging the subjects position without the viewfinder.If you want to get your toes wet into the world of polaroid photography the Instax Mini 8 is a great first step. You'll develop a feel for the limitations of instant camera and there is always an opportunity to upgrade to a "real" polaroid camera if you find yourself in love with instant photography.
Love it! The camera is really something. Can't wait to use it for the holidays! Very happy with this product.
The Girls Loved them for Christmas and still do.
Such a cute camera. It is very easy to use as well. We bought this for my daughters 11th birthday and we have not be disappointed. It is so cute and the pictures are a great quality too!
TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK ~~ DO NOT PURCHASE !!!
I bought this camera for my daughter's sweet 16 birthday.  She loves it.  Very cute, especially go with the camera case which included in the bundle of accessories being purchased separately.
My daughter loves this
I wish I could use this more, but the film is so expensive. Really, it is above and beyond my expectations. I just wish I had the extra dough to shell out whenever I feel artistic or have an event.
good color but difficult to use
Bought as a gift! Not necessarily for the professional photographer in your life, but a very fun, nostalgic way to capture moments on the fly, and comes in such a cute modern style (plus anyone can find a color they like). Arrived quickly, no problems with seller, fully intact with no damages or marks, and the price isn't bad.
Honesty, this is the best camera film i ever had. I don't know why people complain about its exposure and all. There's nothing wrong with this camera. Before I bought this camera, i look at reviews and questions. Most of questions are common and repeatedly asked. I'll just say it and be done with it. This is a film camera which mean everything is not digital, everything is kind of old fashioned way. You take a picture and it automatically print a film picture. It will seem clear white as a paper but, wait for about 20-40 seconds. The color will develop as the film picture itself too. This work through 2 AA batteries. Before you buy this, this camera is gonna be an different experience for you if you're digital photographer or use digital camera because this camera is a F I L M camera. This camera  actually only focus on exposure which means you'll need to take pictures at the right lighting. Never take a picture with light behind you indoor unless you change your setting to "Hi-key". i tried it and it works. I have not try other settings since Hurricane Matthew issue. There are five settings: Cloudy, Sunny, High Sunny, Indoor and Hi-key. Ok, i have already discussed this so now the film packages. Most of people complain about the cost of it, my suggestion is to buy film packages on AMAZON ONLY! it will save up your money so much. I actually bought 100 sheets of film for $60. AMAZING RIGHT?! Anyways, another tips for this camera is once your pictures have printed, please do not shake the photo or touch the picture itself because it will damage the quality or ruin the pictures. Yes there are other accessories you can buy with this camera in BUNDLE! mirror selfie is not included. any of other accessories is not included with camera itself, unless it's in bundle. you have to buy it separately. please read the label before you add it to your cart. make sure you have the right item that you wanted. Yes this camera go by many colors. If the flash isn't required for the picture you're planning to take, please have something cover it like tape or something. do not use your hand, it will bring out the colors in the pictures in weird way. I hope you'll love your camera as I have loves mine! :)
Exactly what she wanted and it got here fast
it was great
Take all such cute pictures!!! Gives it a old time look. I couldn't stop taking pictures with it.
This was a gift and much liked by the person I bought it for. I already had one and they liked it. It is difficult to see your object because to viewer is so tiny. Recommend to others, just be prepared for the price of the film.
Bad photo quality
My daughter loved this camera! Good pics!
Perfect
Yay!!!! I love it ^.^ Now they are every where though. I don't know how the price compares now.
Perfect All
Great purchase for a teenager boy for vacation! Exploring pictures from everything from waffle pictures to silly pictures of cousins! The camera was light and could fit in his back short pockets and easily in his hand. Best gift! Whole family had a blast looking and laughing at pictures!!!
My son bought this camera for his fiancée as a birthday gift! She really loves it and has gotten a lot of use out of it in the two weeks that she's owned it. It's really neat to see Polaroid pictures coming back! The pictures reminds me so much of pictures in the 1970s! These Polaroids are smaller than the 1970s version, but are just as fun. She says the camera is easy to use, fun to operate, and very durable. My future daughter-in-law highly recommends this camera. The film for this camera is expensive, and unlike digital, there really is no do over. That being said, it's still fun to have tangible pictures that you can hand out to people. Remember, the pictures don't actually have to be shaken to develop. In fact, the directions say not to shake the picture. That's disappointing, since shaking the picture was such a part of the 1970s Polaroid experience . But  shaking the picture didn't do anything then either.
Awesome camera.
Bought this camera a few months ago. But never really had the need for it until recently. At first pictures developed fine. But now. Every single picture taken comes out yellow! So upset!!!!!!!
I'm rating this a five star product because it was a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it. I haven't seen it myself so you'll have to take the word of a twelve year old!
Very cute! Persons are always complimenting this camera.
I bought this for my daughter she was so happy ,  the camera is amazing ✬
10 year old LOVES this. Its adorable and we bought a case with shoulders straps for her to carry it around. It is the cutest camera and the pictures are so fun.
great camera, great gift for the daughter. Works great
OBSESSED with this camera. Clean and easy to use!
Excellent gift
Can't wait to have fun with this camera.  My kids love taking pictures.
Very very good
I honestly love polaroids because they we're something that I always enjoyed playing with and shooting pictures with. This was so affordable and it came in very quickly. Everything came in tact and it's ready to take pictures wtih! It's not too heavy or bulky to put into your purse. I personally love this camera!
Bought the pink one as a gift for my sister to take to on her bachelorette weekend. She loved it and it was a big hit! The pink color is very light and pretty much looks like the color in the picture. The camera was very easy to use and the polaroids came out great. Bought the fuji film to go with this camera.
When evere i took pic the pic is blared.very upset.i spend money for bundle my all money wasted.
My daughter loves it. But picture comes out small and not as clear.
It's such a great camera. I was so excited when it arrived and it takes awesome photos
Love it! So cute and way cheaper here than in any stores. Easy to carry and has several settings including indoor and outdoor!
Awesome quality! Great seller!
Does not work good, all the pictures are very dark I will be returning it.
My daughter loves it. The perfect teen gift.
Works great my girl loves it
Great camera, especially for the price. Just know that the view finder does not align with the lens so if you use the view finder to take pictures, they will be off centered. It takes a bit of experimentation to figure out how to not have photos that are too dark or over exposed. I used this camera to take pictures on my wedding day and have the photos in an album. It was fun to get the photos instantly and the album serves as great memories of the day.
Lots of fun! Only close up items show up in the photo. Film sometimes jams and does a double exposure. Used for a wedding photo booth and was perfect for the event.
12 yr old loved this for her birthday!!
This one was for one of my granddaughters and she loves it. I had bought a blue one out of curiosity for myself, and I think Fuji got it right. It is much like the retro Polaroids, except they made the pictures smaller (wallet sized) which significantly reduced the cost. The cost is about $1 a picture. If you have to ask why buy this camera when you can take pictures with a smartphone, this item really is not for you.
I love it
Camera works great!
Gift
I absolutely love this camera! the photos are so cute and perfect for my journal! you won't be disappointed.
Started taking pictures right away..
Gife
No where near as good as the PolaroidNo zoom, pics are blurry and no SD card
Perfect gift for my 13 year old daughter who lives taking pics of anything and everything.
Was a gift given but I heard no complaints!
My camera stopped working out of nowhere , I am not paying for a new one . My money needs to be reimbursed or send a new camera .
Love it! Just as described!
definitely worth it. comes with great packing
With this camera we were able to capture great moments at our wedding. We have used it since then and I has brought fun to our memories.
Love the camera!
I love it!It works as it should.The high-key option is a fun addition to the other lighting/flash options.I'm very glad that I got this camera, and cannot wait to use it more!
The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 is by far one of my best investment! Wasn't sure it was possible to fall in love with this newer version of the Polaroid camera. The camera has sensors that tell you the best setting for the camera, leaving you with great results. It's very easy to load and operate. It's a great camera to use with friends and family, you get the best memories of life with this classic look
A fun thing to have on hand, and it makes great gifts.
I bought this camera for my sister. She fell in love with this camera. This Camera is worth every penny of it. It also takes amazing pictures.
Omg it was a hard choice choosing between this and the pink one but I don't regret the extra money I paid for the hello kitty one
This is a fun little camera, takes ten years off its subjects. Using it to take pics for my sons baby album and it's so much fun!
I thought this would be a fun, retro sort of gift for my seven year old daughter, and I was right.  She loves this camera!  She loves to photograph her younger brothers and her friends.  She didn't put it down for days.  The only reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five stars is because the replacement film can get really expensive!  I had to tell my daughter to be a little selective in what she photographs.  She's used to the camera on my cell phone where she can take essentially an unlimited number of pictures.  I guess that's also part of the retro experience though!There are some cheap options for photo albums to go along with this.  I bought one of those as well, and it has been a great little add-on.  It's cool to assemble all the pictures together in the album and page through the pictures.  Otherwise, the photos get spread all over the house and end up lost!
This is a really neat camera for a kid!  Takes Instant Polaroid pictures so your child can capture all those fun moments with their friends.  Easy to use
Easy to use and takes great pix. Luv it!
Daughter loves her birthday gift
I love my camera! It's cute and handy and impresses everyone who sees it. Everyone always wants their own photo to take home! Gets dirty easily though so get a case with straps for it!
Love this camera. Quick shipping as always from Amazon. Thank you.
worth having one
It's a little larger than I had hoped, but other than that, it's amazing! It brings back a lot of memories of polaroid cameras from my childhood. The photographs develop nicely and fairly quickly. Overall, this poroduct is everything that I had hoped for, it's adorable and I am so happy that I own it.
Perfect, and everything you'd expect it to be. I recommend buying rechargeable batteries for this.
Fun little camera! Film is cheap on Amazon also. My sister and I took a bunch of pictures at Christmas with it, it traveled on a plane with me, and still works just fine.
Best Birthday present I've given in years!  Went thru 100+ pics over the weekend.  Had a blast and everyone has a pic they can put anywhere!
ok
Should've came with at least two extra batteries not one it takes two
I love this camera, bought it to use for special things we do as a family! It works great and I love how it prints out little pictures so fast and right on the spot! Would absolutely recommend to anyone who wants a good instant print camera
Bought it for my daughter's birthday present and she loves it! Easy to use and she could use it w/o needing help of an adult.
perfect
Liek Liek
My 11 year old daughter loves to take pictures so this camera has been excellent for her. Even my 4 year old loves the simplicity of it as she used an entire thing of film by herself...oops! We now have lots of pictures of the dog :) The color is great too! Very easy to use and instant which is good.
excelent
Cute camera but picture quality not as good as I would have liked.  My 11 year old daughter is really into photography and has been using this camera quite a bit
My daughter loved it! Christmas gift
it takes amazing pictures
It is fun, easy to use, quality is perfect, re like
Works fine, but pictures are so tiny it is hard to get a good picture.
Got it as a present for my girlfriend and she loves it
We have two of these cameras they are awesome and the pictures turn out very clear
Love it
It was a present for my daughter HARLEY at Christmas. I  haven't heard any complaints.
recently it stopped working
This thing is so fun. I ordered it for my birthday last January and it still works like a charm. My only problem is with the price of the refills.
I absolutely love it! It's super cute and stylish. Everytime a bring it around my friends, they all say they want one! The only thing is that the system for different lighting is a bit off and confusing to work with, but I'm getting the hang of it!
very cute and very fun. but don't use it daytime outdoor otherwise the photo will look so white.
So cute ,Love it ,came a day early and I just need film to try it out.
amazing
Amazing little polaroid camera.  Takes excellent pictures.  Compact and easy to use.  I would definitely purchase this item again.  I bought this item as a bundle with the twin pack of film.
Awesome!!!
Husband and I enjoyed out little camera at our honeymoon and now always use it for other get away or memories in general when we go camping, vacation, trips etc <3 great size pics for scrap booking!
Great camera! Bought it for my upcoming wedding and I can't wait to use it.  There's not much to the camera, it's simple to use.
This camera is OK if you are just wanting to take selfies but I bought it for a trip hoping my kids could use the pictures and journal about their days on the trip. When trying to take a picture of buildings or scenery, the pictures just didn't turn out. I wasted a lot of film because of this.
Awesome fun camera!!!
Cute camera
I ordered this camera as a present for my girlfriend and she loves it. She takes it with us when we go hiking, to festivals, and on vacation. We have captured some pretty good pictures on it. It took a minute for us to learn and understand the exposure settings but after getting a hang of it we started to get more clear pictures. She loves that it prints the photos instantly and she can throw them up on our fridge or walls. I was worried about how expensive the film refills were going to be but amazon has double the film for half the price you can buy in store so I ordered her that and we will continue to order from amazon. Overall we are very happy with this camera.
So fun! Love this! Works best with close-up photos!
I really like using this camera, it is fun.  But of course the quality of pictures are low res and the directions for the settings aren't very clear.  We still love to have fun with it.  My 8 year old daughter got one too, and now her twin brother wants one for Christmas.
This camera did not work. I wasted an entire roll of film, all of the pictures came out extremely dark if not black. I did a bit of research online to make sure it wasn't user error and discovered that these cameras are prone to breaking. I returned this one and bought a new one at Target for just a few dollars more and it has worked perfectly. Not an item to buy used I suppose.
Great design. Photos are what you'd expect from an instant camera.
Daughter loved it! Bought her the purple!!
Perfect, just as expected.
Easy to load and easy to use
Works great!
Cute and lightweight
Love it!
Product is great!
I bought this for a beach trip and while I had to play with the settings; like I researched you had to for a perfect picture; I absolutely loved the pictures that resulted. I also loved the color I got, which was raspberry. It's a very neat little camera that brings out the very special moments you want to use it for.
grands loved the concept of instant pics
Daughter loves
Great.
My granddaughter loved it.
Have wanted this forever but it's so expensive in stores. But online you save a lot buying it, even the film for it is so much more affordable online! Recommend buying this ❤️
haven't had a problem with this product yet! i really love it as of right now!
Great cameras for teens. A little pricey in my opinion but takes good pictures. Pretty durable and color is exactly as pic shows. Was available for prime so that was a plus.
So much fun especially now being in a digital age I love actually taking real photos.  We made a fun little album of our trip to Portugal.  The price is great too.
works great with great pics. Awesome product! Going to get some as christmas gifts.
I was very excited about purchasing this camera!! The pics are small enough to put in an envelope to send to my daughter at Air Force Basic Military Training. So I ordered 2 packs of film with it. I unpacked everything, put batteries in the camera, and put the film in the camera. There are little to no instructions for the camera or the film, but pretty easy to figure out. So I take the first pic and the black think comes out. Ok, got it. I take another pic and it doesn't develop. Then another and another. So I start google searching why my pics aren't developing. I come across and answer that says the shutter may not be closing. So sure enough, I look at the lens while I snap the pic and the shutter doesn't close. I get on Amazon and initiate the return process. In the meantime, I'm still wanting this camera, so I order another. Guess what!!!! It doesn't work either. The shutter is not closing when I take a pic. Can this even be possible???? It is user error??? If so, what could the error possibly be???? I watched youtube videos to be certain I am doing everything I'm supposed to do. All my pics do NOT develop!!! I'm returning this one as well. Scared to order another.  Very SAD!!
Was a little larger than I thought it would be.
Love this camera, perfect to have at parties. My grandpa visited it and it melted his heart after we took a photo together that now he gets to keep in his wallet! I have never used a camera like this before. Please do not expect HD pics coming out of this camera.
Love this camera!!
I accidentally reviewed this camera under the 'case' review. I gave it a good review and the case is equally good. Cute package to carry around.
Definitely would recommend to everyone, Everything was PERFECT! I absolutely love this camera!
The best
Lots of fun, we like it
For a while there, I had a different model of this instax camera, and while I loved it, it took up so much space and most times, I'd be too lazy to lug it around with me. After getting this, it makes it way easier to carry it around with me and I've since then started to build a little collection of pictures.
This is a fun little instant camera. Don't expect amazing quality photos, but its fun for the nostalgia of polaroid style pictures.
simply the best out there
There's something about vintage pictures that is amazing, and this camera does exactly that. No more paying $5 for a single picture, the Fujifilm is awesome!!!!
Waste of money. You purchase this knowing it's not the most practical item, we all have a camera in our pocket. We get it because it's a nostalgic item or because Pinterest posted a fun wedding photo booth idea, right? I fell for the later. I had several really awesome photos but the settings wouldn't work correctly, we couldn't get the flash to fire, film was coming out black, it was such a let down. We still used it at my reception but we went through so many things of film to get the few photos we have. The film is so expensive - it's so painful to troubleshoot without waisting $20.I'd recommend purchasing the bluetooth portable zinc printer instead. You'd have a better quality photo + you can still have that instant vintage photo without having to lug an extra camera around with you. Save that $50 bucks for film.
Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera (Grape). I love this little instant camera. It has been a long time since I was able to take a picture and instantly hold it in my hand. There is something really special about it. I have it so much fun with this thing. It takes good pictures and is very well made. I can't put this thing down. I love it.
This works really amazing and it is very easy to use(:
Was a gift for someone, and they really like it
I got three and they shipped three days earlier and im so excited to try them!!
Love this camera
So fun
This was a huge hit with my granddaughter!
The pictures turn out great, really easy to use and practical.
very good product. fast delivery and good quality.
Love the color and style but the Camera didn't produce the photo. It seemed like it was jammed.
Gift for my 17 year old. I think I may love this camera more than my teen daughter. Perfect present! I recommend getting the accessory pack along with it (case and multiple colored lenses, selfie lens, stickers and frames).
I love this camera!  Easy to use and makes such cute little pictures.
Simply best bang for your buck Polaroid camera you can buy. The films are reasonably priced too. Would recommend it to anyone that's interesting in a Polaroid camera.
Love this little camera Flash's super bright so watch out
Amazing camera for teens. So Tumblr and fun. Film is expencive but if you buy it it is worth it.
I've gone through two of these cameras and they are complete junk. One only produced overexposed film (and I tried several cartridges) and the other just stopped taking pictures. I changed the batteries, tried different film cartridges. It makes noise and lights up but nothing comes out.I can't figure out why these cameras are so highly rated. I think they are a complete waste of money.
My 10 year old daughter loves her camera.  Easy to use, good quality.
There's something truly special about being able to capture a moment, a feeling, and then to have something tangible to remember it by in your hands within a few seconds. With smartphones and digital cameras, it's easy to take photographs and to be able to see them instantly. Having this film camera in your hands changes your perspective on how you take photographs. With every pack of film, you're only able to take 10 photographs. It makes you really capture what is important to you, and makes you think about how you use your film instead of taking a hundreds of photographs.The photographs make great gifts or DIY projects. You can even take the photographs and turn them into magnets to put on your fridge! This camera is so easy to use and fun too. You insert your new pack of film into the back of the camera to start using it. There is an on/off switch near the lens that turns the camera on. The flash makes this camera perfect for either day or nighttime use! You don't have to worry about whether or not it is too dark for your photo to show up. To take a photo, all you have to do is press the round button under the viewfinder. There are so many accessories and cases you can decorate your camera with and to keep it safe. The camera is also light enough to carry with you in your bag, when you don't want to lug around a big camera! So fun to bring with you on vacation, trips with your friends, concerts or anywhere else you would want to remember.
This camera is so cool! Bought it for my wedding. It was a smash hit!
Love love love it! Everyone should invest in a Polaroid camera.
Love this product
Camera is pretty darn good. Would have given it 5 stars but I think the pictures are a bit too small.
Heavier than I expected. Still figuring out how to take good pictures with this, they all come out a little darker than I would like. Cool little camera though, fun hobby... just wish the film wasn't so expensive. Camera is very easy to set up and included batteries.
we really love this camera
My girls loves these  cameras...only down side photo paper goes really fast and and photo paper kinda expensive
My daughter absolutely loved this camera. This is like a new polariod version with extra little features like designs and you can take selfies with it. It arrived when promised. Happy with this purchase.
Camera works great!
Broken and not working waste money!!!! There is no refund I guess I'm unhappy
Awesome camera!
Love love love
I love this camera! I've always loved polaroids. The purple one is pretty. I get lots of compliments.The only down side is that there is not way to turn off the flash; or at least I can't find a way to. So far I just use my finger to cover it.
Shipped quickly! Absolutely love it!
Outstanding , and funny!!!
Met my expectations
works like a charm
Awesome camera!  My daughter LOVES it!
This is a great little camera. Easy to use, easy to set up, easy film loading. For the price and the instant satisfaction of seeing your photos, it's worth it. This is the second one I've purchased, both were for my teenage daughters. They use them all the time. Film can be expensive, but worth it for the physical, vintage style memories. I've toyed with the idea of getting another for myself.
not very practical, expensive, doesn't take perfect pictures if you mess up. This thing is everything I wanted it to be.It's cool I love that you can still even get these things. They're just something about having a physical camera that prints a picture for you before your eyes.This thing is not for photographers it's for fun!
Brought it for a gift  The person was so excited and too happy
Great gift!!
Good product. The complimentary films run out very quick though
my daughter loved this camera!  so fun and pictures are great.  traveled with us on road trip and was a hit with the kids!
Bought for another.
Super cute camera, coolest thing I've ever bought on Amazon. Good price and great quality pictures. Don't take pictures too close they come out blurry
I love the quality of the photos. Also, it's easy to use and super cute
Really small and cute.  Would not buy for myself but i got it for my son and he really enjoys it.  It's more for kids than adults.
Girlfriend loves the vintage feel the pictures come out as.
Sometimes I require instant gratification, and this fulfills that need, plus it's gives a nice little memento that is fun and a conversation piece. I feel like I'm holding a huge egg yolk in my hands (since I got the yellow), but it's like holding happiness because everyone smiles when then see the picture pop out instantaneously. I trust the Fuji brand for quality so I believe I will be enjoying this for years to come. The only negative is the expensive film, but I went into it knowing the cost so I really have room to complain.
Granddaughter loves it
I got this for my nieces 8th birthday. She was so excited that I got this and all the accessories to go with it. Unfortunately this camera did nothing but waste my money. We tried the pictures in different ways, in the sun, out of the sun, in the dark, out of the dark, every possible angle and nothing. the pictures were dark, you couldn't tell what the pictures were, they were coming out blank or blurry.  sorry were are sending this back and are going to try the instax 70 or 90. I still haven't decided yet??
Beautiful! my niece loved it!
This was a tween gift. It was well received.
Although I don't prefer the color pink, this camera works well and has not caused any issues. Now having owned it for a year the camera has been used a lot and continues to work as it did when I first purchased it.
Got this for my niece and she loves it.......she's taken at least ten packs of film with it.  Mostly pictures of her cat!!!
I love this camera its perfect for party's
Great am in love my friends went crazy over it wanted to know where I brought it and price so I guess they about to Order pretty soon
beautiful
Was first prize in our lucky draw and everyone went crazy for it. Thanks for getting it to us in time!
Having lots of fun with this
Amazing! Just received my Instax Mini 8, and it is AWESOME! I bought it originally for my sisters bridal shower, but I'm going to start taking this everywhere I go! The quality is great. Everything is overall in shape. Great quality.
Great camera and my grand daughter loves it.  Simple and straightforward to use.  A fun camera
This is a great camera! We have used it ever since we got it!
Daughter loves it!
The camera is amazing and extremely easy to use! I love getting physical copies, so cool!!
It works perfectly. Definitely a good buy.
Pretty alright i guess
TO HAPPY TO GET IT TAKE GREAT PICTURE GOT IT FOR THIS CHRISTMAS JUST TESTED TO MAKE SURE IT WORKED AND SO FAR SO GOOD HOPE IT HOLD UP THEN. DIDNT  OPEN EVERYTHING AGAIN ITS FOR THIS CHRISTMAS 2016
Have purchased this in the past and is perfect for young adults on the go.
Love this camera, easy to use. Important to use suggested focus
So fun - I had a poloroid camera as a kid, so love this version for my child. We used different color photo papers for a photo booth at a birthday party and it made great memories AND souveneirs! Amazon's price for this camera was really great.
Such a fun gift idea!
Got this camera for my girlfriend, she LOVES it!recommended for everyone, great present for anyone! (especially your girlfriend(; )
this camera is great.. brings some nostalgia back to taking and saving photos.  Outdoor photos are perfect.  Indoor are great as long as there is a light on. Some of the pictures taking in the dark were not very easy to see. In other words, the flash is not made for professional photos.  This camera is fun, there are lots of photo albums, frames and accessories to include with this item.  I purchased mine to use at a baby shower.  It was a huge hit.  People got to take home photos of themselves with friends etc.  I included small frames and photo albums in the party favor bags  I will use it again and again.
I'd always wanted this camera..but it's not great..poor quality pics..hard to adjust to lighting.. Not what I was expecting based off of other reviews
So excited about this! I love using it, and it's small enough to carry around with me. I love it!
Great!
Love love this Polaroid! It takes awesome photos and is adorable.
good quality and great buy.
Super... I love it!!!
Excelente
Great camera and a lot of fun.
Bought it for my niece on her birthday.  She is adores it. Great product all around
Great camera! takes super cute pictures but I don't have much to say for the camera details since it was a gift.
So much fun! Everyone loves using an instant camera.
As usual a good purchase. The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 is great for people who prefer actual physical photos but don't like the obnoxious photo sizes of other cameras. These are even good for people who love the very old film cameras. Would buy again (Of course I bought a 2 year warranty) Great price!
Bought it for my 10 year old and she LOVES it.  I just had to teach her to change the settings if you are outside or inside otherwise the picture does not come out
We got this for our wedding guestbook and it was a ton of fun.  The camera itself seems sturdy and well-made, was easy to get running, and takes adorable Polaroid-style pictures.  The photos tend to look a bit faded but I think that's part of the charm, right?
good
an excellent little photography treasure! the blue is very true to color. the matte smooth surface resists scratching, unless you really claw at it. i've had it for years with only faint smudges to show for it. i love how it comes in multiple colors. loading the film is very easy, there's a small window in the back that counts down to let you know how many sheets you have left before it's time to replace. the only minor gripe i have is that the lens extension button is very easy to accidentally press while in your purse. i solved this by buying a case with a front flap, so it doesnt get jostled while being tossed around in my bag.
Takes cute pictures. Smaller than the older polaroids but still have that old school feel. Just make sure to read the instructions. Put it on the setting the camera recommends (the one that has the blinking light) or your pictures may not coming out very good.
gift for my 6-year old daughter. she can easily load film and take pics. bought the bundle (camera, film, case)...great deal.
Great!
There are not a lot of instant picture printing cameras in the market yet, from what was available. I found this with the good and highest reviews. I decided to buy this as a gift for my best friend. Please view the unboxing video to see what is inside the box.NOTE: Please make sure you buy the instax films as well as shown in the video because there are no sample films included with the camera.First impressions: The looks, design and build quality are amazing. It is funky looking with vibrant colors which actually suit the camera. Pretty easy to use for starters. I see there are about 5 settings which you can use depending on the light. It is not too big, but yes, buying a camera case would be better to carry it around rather than throwing it in your backpack. It is a little delicate so be careful.The camera comes with 2 batteries which are easy to find in the market and a wrist strap. I feel they should have also included a camera case with this product.The films are about the size of your credit card and the pictures are not HD. This camera is just for fun, but there is something different about this pictures. When you look at them you actually relive the moment.I will update this review with more pictures and details on how to use it once we actually click some pictures.
my daughter loves this camera we have had so much fun with it.  thanks
My granddaughter loved it! She has to fight off her sisters, So much fun!!!
Great product
Perfect gift for the girlfriend who loves to take pictures
It's a very nice cool camera and it's so easy to use the pictures usually come out great, it's great to give people these pictures instead of just taking them from a phone, I think it adds a bit of sentimental value. I wish they weren't so tiny pictures so you can see a bit more detail but all in all it's great.
I got it as a gift and she likes the camera. The camera takes good pictures depending on the distance. Too far and it starts to be blurry. And the flash does give extra lighting (doesn't look like too much light), so it can be used for dark settings. But don't expect it to have special effects like most cameras have now. If you're looking for really sharp pictures, this is not the camera for you. If you're looking for one that you can use for souvenirs, it is a good one.
The box is a little mushed up ... But the camara works fine, the problem was with the package
so nice for the price so nice all together
Love the camera! It's great for parties I tell my guests to take a pic and leave a pic so that I can make a photo album from the event.
A BIG hit for our 11 yr old granddaughter's birthday
the purchase was perfect
It makes an amazing pics.. Recomended!)!)!
Exactly what I wanted. Way cheaper than in stores
Great item. A bit bulky but the newer model which this is, allows different exposure settings so they come out not too overexposed.
Exactly what I was looking for!!
ordered by accident
Used it for my wedding. Total blast
I bought the camera with film for my mom's birthday present and she absolutely loved it (along with the color choice too!!). Thank you for your wonderful service and I look forward to ordering a lot more items from your company in the near future!!
Loved this camera for my 9yo birthday.  It's perfect for giving her some creative ability.HINT: Make sure you buy film when you buy it... otherwise you will have some disappointment that someone cannot take a photo immediately.
I love this camera! I bought it to take pictures at my sister's Bachelorette party and wedding. I figured the women would enjoy taking pictures and are able to keep the film for memories. As soon as I opened the box my 6 year old son fell in love with it. He took it with him to the grocery store and snapped pictures of people as we shopped. Of course we asked before snapping a picture, and some of the customers were quite fond of our camera. My son convinced a few to buy one as he handed them their picture. Even though the film is wallet sized, I'm still happy with the product. I might have to  order one for my son, along with plenty of film.
Love this camera but film is expensive. This was a hit at a party. Fun to have. Gave photos to guests and they loved it!
I've been wanting this camera for so long I decided to save up and this is the best gift u could give To yourself if you're wondering about  getting it go for it !!!
Arrived very fast and in excellent Status
I LOVE these cameras!! They are so awesome! and the film is really a great price compared to older polaroid cameras!
We ordered this super cute Instax mini instant camera for our granddaughters birthday and she just loved it.  I takes instant mini Polaroid like pictures.  We purchased this in blue and paired it with an accessories kit that had a galaxy cosmos print synthetic leather case.  It looks amazing together.  I like that this is a little compact but still very easy to handle camera.  I think it can handle a few bumps from an active lifestyle of a teen which is part of the reason we chose this model.  It is easy to use, easy to install and reload film.  Overall, this was a wonderful gift for the granddaughter and she was off taking photos before the end of the day.
Arrived in non-working condition. I bought it for a wedding, and was too busy to return it, so was just a loss. Very disappointing.
Received this about 7 min ago I absolutely love it. Easy to use and so much fun.
Light, cute, and easy to use. Downsides worth mentioning are that the film packets only come with 10 sheets and getting used to the camera took me pretty much an entire pack. Another thing to note is that using the viewfinder makes the pictures come out off center. If you're looking into buying this product for the first time, I'd definitely recommend buying extra film to give yourself some leeway when trying to figure out how to take the best pictures you can.
Nice
obsessed, I literally carry this thing with me everywhere I go, it takes BEAUTIFUL pictures.
Love it!
Got this camera for my daughter's birthday. So much fun! She is 8 and is having a blast with it. But be warned that the film adds up quickly!
Great camera
Captures photos as expected, I olny think that the Photos are too expensive
I purchased this camera for my niece.  She loves it! Amazon has a great selection of different photo papers. I think its a great toy to get kids into photography and to be more creative.  She loves to take pics of her friends and gift them photos.
Bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it.
This was our 3rd one because we love them so much.  They are for our kids, but we use them too.  Fun cameras to have around.
The one I received DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. There is no visible damage but it does not work. It is a gift for my friend in China and I did not open it until I got back to China. So I missed the return time cause I am not back in the US until now. I am so mad.
Great. Thanks.
I bought this for my niece, she loves it.
I love it, I love it, I love it!
I got this as a bday gift from my husband and it's verry cute..i just adore them so much..i haven't quite learn how-to use it just yet..but my husband is teaching me how..the camera and Thw accessories are just so cute..love love them❤
Love it so much, I take tons of pictures and stick them on my wall.
Wonderful price for a wonderful camera! The color is super cute and the camera itself is very easy to hold and great to take fun pictures with
My daughter enjoyed using this camera. Pictures develop immediately.
I love these cameras! I have bought 3 as gifts and everyone I have given them to love them. The pictures come out so cute and are a great way to capture memories. I have had mine for almost 4 years and it is still working great.
I thought the color was brighter, but still Pink, and still an Instax! Love it ...
My nine year old loves her new camera!
It worked great and now doesn't work, :(  and can't figure out how to return to company ...
Super fun camera! Great to use to teach kids to take pictures. It has a circle in eyesite to help center the pictures.
Love love love.Great for keeping memories and it's so easy to use.
Received exactly what I wanted in a timely fashion very happy with my purchase
The camera came very quick and works perfectly!
I really like the idea of this camera.  However, I would note that if you take a photo in the daylight (even under shade), the photo that comes out becomes overexposed.  When in the sunlight, the photo is completely white (i.e. totally overexposed).  Not exactly conducive to use.
Everyone loves the pictures and the quality is awesome
Photos definitely turn out best in normal lights or sunlight. Photos in low lights/filtered lights don't turn out the best (or in mirrors because the flash ruins it)In cloudy weather colors aren't as saturated and the sky turns out a little grey rather than the actual blue you see in person (at least my experience in San Francisco)All other photos though turn out great and how I expected :)
Birthday gift and she loves it
It's a really great camera!!! Pictures print out really fast and come out pretty clear!!  Love it!
Love the pics and kids have great fun.
cute, but to me seems overpriced.
my eight year old grand-daughter loved this camera.  the only draw back is the cost/amount of film sheets.  my granddaughter immediately wanted to take pictures of everyone at her party and very quickly used up all the sheets she got as gifts.  the camera however, works great and is easily operated by an 8 year old.
Thought this would be a fun "toy" for teenagers who love instant images (vs using their digital camera and waiting to upload/share).  Either the camera or the film (Or both) are not quality as only half of the pictures seem to come out at all.  At first we thought it was "first time" user adjustments and we kept it and kept using it and then the time to return/exchange it passed.  It's fine but I think there are better ones out there and they won't disappoint the teens as often with the production of grey film every other photo for no reason.
Very fun, great novelty for party
This is a great polaroid for the price (not taking into consideration how much the costs of film will pile up in the long run). However, don't expect perfection. I had high expectations for this camera due to the thousands of positive reviews, and it really does add up. But in the end, it is more or less a toy. It's cheaply (but well-) manufactured; the viewfinder is not connected to the lens, so if you center the subject you want to capture with the guide in the viewfinder, the picture will not come out centered. Think of the lens and viewfinder in the sense of how it's physically positioned; the lens is positioned about an inch to the left of and lower than the viewfinder. The picture will come out this position if you use the guide of the viewfinder, so adjust accordingly after some practice shots. This means that, yes, you will waste some shots out of your expensive film cartridge.Another reason why I gave it a three-star review (on top of it feeling super delicate like a toy in your hands) is because the camera itself will not always print the last film of your cartridge or the count will be off. I've practiced with a few cartridges, and the count is incorrect more often than not, leading you to believe you have that last picture to use when you really don't, or its count will be off and not print the last film that you have. I've seen other Youtube videos where users have had the same issue, so I think with such a cheap camera, this will happen every now and then.But all in all, I'm super pleased with the vintage look and shots that I've captured thus far. It's not a perfect Polaroid camera, but it does the job, and you'll look cute while you're at it.
I will be using this for my wedding guest book. Product shipped quickly. I took a test pic and it came out great!
Worked for about a week, then the flash stopped working and it's just been in my corner ever since.
Bought 2 of these as gifts. Both recipients loved. Highly recommend
I love it! The product it's exactly like the picture. And the photos are great!
Works great, looks great, pictures come out fast and look awesome!
Product came quickly and exactly as advertised! However, the box came damaged and it was for a gift. Not as appealing but gift was still in working order.
So cute! I use it all the time!
Pictures do not come out clear. A lot come out white washed.. Loved the idea but not to buy..
my kids love it they say there making  memories
Fun camera for kids...except the film for it is expensive
Excellent Service, Excellent Product!  Absolutely love it!
Super cute camera...great for any Hello Kitty fan!!!
Can't be leave these things are cumming back!  A product that really was not that great in the 70's but my daughter (15) thought this was the greatest thing ever.  Big hit with the friends.....I don't get it...but she's happy!  You don't get many pictures out of film packs
Great camara. The pics are a bit smaller that i touhgt.
Love it!
So cute
Wonderful product. Nostalgia galore! Takes great photos!
I absolutely love my new camera! The pictures come out instantly and the quality is great. I love that the lens automatically adjusts to the setting that I'm in. My family and friends all want one now. Lol. This is the best birthday gift I could've given to myself!
Great camera:) no complaints. Love the little pictures.
My Granddaughter loves it.  Thank you.
At first I couldn't get all the lights to stop flashing in the front and had to go through 3 different batteries to fix it. Seems to be working now
Awesome camera! Love having the photos print out instantly.
This camera is great! I just wish it came with a strap or something. I feel like it's a cheap plastic and will break if I drop it!
We set up the camera per instructions and lights on front keep blinking, indicating a need for new batteries. New batteries did not help. It just keeps blinking and making a revving up sound. I will be returning.
Nice
Really nice products, my GF have lot of fun with it. I bought this camera for my GF bday, with Fujifilm INSTAX Mini Instant Film Twin Pack.  I'm not a big fan of instant camera, i'm more digital, but this one change my mind. For digital camera you took a picture and save it on computer, i guess that you still have to picture but to me, instant camera that capture the perfect moment, and you can take it with you better than go on computer and printed.  Instant camera seem more memorable than digital, in my opinion.  Great product and highly recommended.
HUGE HIT!!!!  Purchased for my daughter for her birthday.  She is in love with this camera.....she is now bringing it everywhere with her.Easy to use and perfect size not huge like the Polaroid cameras of my youth.
great
It's great but the first day I got it it broke :( . It does feel cheap and plastic-y.
It completely stopped working. I used it since June this year and was loving it. Now, every time that I turn on my camera, it just flashes and I can't take pictures. I honestly don't know what happened, but I can't replace it or return it anymore. Very little life... Extremely disappointed.
A cute little camera! I used it for my wedding and the guests absolutely loved taking pictures with it!
I loved it came fast and it's what I expected I loved it 😍
Inlove it
I want to love this because the pictures that do turn out well are really artsy. I'm the new world Polaroid Picasso. I can't get it to take good pictures that turn out well outside though. They are all so white that you can't tell which side of the cat it is. I guess I would recommend just taking pictures inside if you get this or figuring out how to take pictures outside (the directions aren't in English).
Favorite camera EVER!
Loved it.
This camera is lightweight and easy to throw into a bag and take on the go. I opted to not buy the case and I haven't had any issues thus far, but I also haven't tested this in rugged conditions. It's really a perfect gift for kids, teens and even college age students. I'm in my 30s, but I love it as well.The big downside is that the film is expensive, but I did not let that affect my review of the camera itself.
Very convenient for traveling! I definitely recommend getting the carrying bag/purse for it, as it can get bumped around a lot. I carried mine in my bag, and I would occasionally hear a hum coming from my bag, just to find that I had turned the camera on and popped out the lens by accident.
Girlfriend loves it.
If you are considering getting a Fujifilm Instax Mini, do it! Our niece had one and we used it for my father is laws 75th birthday for a DIY photo both and it was so much fun. Then we barrow it from her with the birth of our son and took picture with everyone the first time they held him and those photos are on a cork board in his room. We loved hers so much we got one for ourselves. The film is easy to load, the batteries last a long time, and the picture quality is great. The film is pricey so it’s not like the digital where you can just take and take picture so we use it sparingly. Each time I bring it more people are impressed by it and ask question about it. Also love that it comes in so many colors.
Present for granddaughterShe is very happy with it
I bought this for my daughter and she was very happy with it, she likes things that are old timey and this was as close as I could get to the one like I had growing up. I really hated to buy it because the film is so expensive and she really likes to take pictures. I also thought the pictures were dark and the quality was not very good.
My daughter loves it!!!
My daughter totally loved getting this for her birthday! The product is well-made and super-cute! It's exactly what we needed to put a HUGE smile on her face and well-worth the price!
Super fun camera.  We use this all the time.  Great for keepsakes.
I love this camera! It has become my go-to for memorable events!
Cute camera and perfect for memories. The film is pricy but worth it. Really recommend and it's still a popular camera
5 year old takes perfect pictures with this!
It's so fun capturing life's little moments with one of these cameras! I am not at all disappointed with my purchase and if you're debating on purchasing one of these, I would highly recommend it.
I take this camera everywhere with me, it was quickly shipped & it's so cute. Hello Kitty is my favorite! Thank you!
love it...
Worked great really fun camera my daughter has a blast with it.
EVERYONE loves my camera! I get compliments every time I take it out and about with my friends. So glad they are making a comeback
Christmas gift for my sister, had some issues getting it to work the first week but after some time on the phone with the manufacturer it was resolved.
some time work and some time is not work.
I love my camera, it's gone everywhere with me this summer including hiking trips to bachelorette parties. Great buy and great memories.
Absolutely love it
Love it! Very happy and pleased with my purchase, I wish I can have all the colors
Girlfriend loved it! Only down fall is film is expensive and goes quickly and easily.
Bought this for a bday gift for my lil girl. She loved it. Film is quite expensive avg $1 a pic. so tell them to practice their shot with their phones before goin trigger happy on the shutter, and start askin you for $20 every couple days to refill their stock.
Exactly what I wanted! Sure, it can be difficult to take the perfect shot, but that's part of the fun of instant film! If you keep in mind that the viewfinder is to the right of the lens and take into consideration the lighting around you, you'll get the hang of it really quickly. For a cheap, fun novelty, this camera is fantastic.
LOVE THE COLOR
I enjoy the camera and the pictures are decent quality. The one downfall is that the pictures are not the "normal polaroid size" you would think.
Was a present for step daughter she loves it
very happy.
Excelent product and delivery!
Ok
I want to thank Amazon for the great delivery. I received this from my boyfriend as a bday gift. And I couldn't be happier. It's a beautiful camera.  I cannot wait for the wonderful Memories to be captured
A great gift for my sister on her birthday, but was annoyed it did not ship with a pack of film in the box.
love love love this item. so happy i got it.
Pictures are very small so difficult to photograph . You have to get up really close or you see very little.  Limited use.
This a great camera and love the fact that they are keeping the polaroid in style. awesome pictures right at your finger tips. Camera is awesome
Excellent camera
It was as expected.
This product arrived defective. I wanted to use it for my guest book and photo booth at my wedding and every single photo came out either completely white or blacked out. Unfortunately, by the time I got back from my honeymoon, it was too late to return the product, so now I'm keft with a defected camera and no way to fix the situation. This is extremely frustrating because it was advertised as in working condition and like new. Yes, the product looked like it was on new condition, but no, it doesn't work. I'm extremely upset that I'm stuck with a broken camera, wasted money on this defective product, and an unreachable seller.
Got this as a gift my gf loves it the pictures come out cool
Love it!!! Best gift you can get to a girl or mother.... Great memories it a pretty way.
Item was perfect
I love it
This camera is great for children and adults alike.  Instant photos are unique.
These cameras are so much fun.  Similar to an old Polaroid.  The film is kind of expensive, but it is just a fun and retro way to take pictures.  I bought one for each of my kids and they have a blast with them.
The best gift my daughter receive
exelent!
I've been wanting this since a friend had one for their wedding guest book! So glad I bought it.Amazon has the best price I've seen and we tried it out at my daughters birthday. It was a hit!
The camera does not work, return it to the seller.
Bought this for a gift for my mother, she loves it and uses it everywhere she goes!
Got this for my grand daughter she takes great pictures...9 years old
Wow!.... I was so excited when I finally recieved this Fujifilm Instax Mini camera. I purchased this for my grand daughter for Christmas. I opened it up and the color Raspberry is beautiful. I thought it came with film so I looked everywhere for it. No film to take photos with. Must purchase separately. So, I just couldn't wait to give it to her. Her cousin from England just arrived and I wanted her to be able to use it. I purchased film and she went crazy with it. The first picture was super light and blurry. Then the second one turned out much better. I think this is the greatest thing since the old Polaroid cameras.
Great for travel. I love the picture modes and just the over all quality. I would recommend this to anyone.
YES!
Great camera
Easy to use camera and really fun at parties. Solid item for the money.  Love this mini 8 camera!  Everyone at the party loved it!
It is awsome but the pack it comes in little PhotoKit
It's a nice, simple camera. Despite its deceptive, almost child's camera looks (I like it, maybe not in everyone's taste), it produces excellent results on a small, credit card-sized film. It fits perfectly into wallets due to its size. Operation of the camera is very user-friendly, simple push the small button to the right of the lens to power on and wait until the camera decides what light level to use. Once it does, an LED will indicate which setting to use. Then line up the shot and push the button below the viewfinder. When taking shots that are close, make sure to remember that the viewfinder and lens are offset, so aim slightly up and right when close. Far shots it doesn't make a difference.
It's easy to use and small enough to use for going on adventures. You don't have to worry about the battery being charged and just bring it and go! Very stylish and vintage-esque. The light settings take a bit of practice at first to see which desired results you want, but other than that everything works amazing! Definitely a universal gift!
good
It works perfectly, no scratches, no cracks, works like as if it was created yesterday!
This camera is super trendy and takes awesome pictures. It's like a blast from the past when you're using the instax mini. The pictures that come out are super vintage looking and make for Great Wall decorations. The camera is a simple point and shoot with different light exposure options. The pictures can be alittle confusing just looking at them but the instructions have it all laid out for you. The family loves taking picture with this to make it feel like the good ol days. You do have to buy film for this but that's an obvious because it prints them instantly.
I bought this as a gift and it came on time and it was everything I needed!
my daughter loves it.
worked well
Bought it for a friend and she loves it.
Cause my daughter loves it ,so it makes me happy.
Simple and easy to use. I love that the photos are easy to load and the film for it is great and vibrant. I like that that the photos that come out look more like they did way back then, but still look more updated. If that makes sense.
Love the camera and the color the only problem is that the indoor outdoor settings twist knob doesn't work properly and when that happens the picture color quality isn't great. When we are outdoors we change the setting to sunny but it flashes the knob twists settings on it its on and pictures come out really bright with a lot of glare. Other than that when it's working it works great and it has taken great quality pics but sometimes it doesn't. So you will waste more film then anticipated.
My 11YO loves this. Only wish the refills weren't so expensive.
it was what i thought great price, pic quality was not quite what i had hoped for but it is an instant camera. It was bought for my 11 year old and it works for her to mess around with and learn about costs of hobbies, film is pricey.
Polaroid is back!!! 10 times better!!!
So far it's a really nice camera! Takes really vivid pictures and my mom loves it!
Nostalgically fabulous!!! SO cute. And retro looking... Even though no old camera ever looked like this.I love this "little" thing. By today's standards NOT so little, but adorable. This thing is not going into your pocket. Maybe not even your purse... Consider purchasing a case with a strap. The light pink color is perfect. It is easy to use and thankfully pretty intuitive... Since the MANY sheets of instructions are fairly worthless. (Particularly if your eyes are over 20 years old!) I never could find exactly how to load the film so I kind of guessed, and it worked...TO LOAD FILM: (Have batteries installed before adding film... THAT I got from the instructions) Simply drop the opened pack of film in the back, with the 2 little indention areas facing OUT towards you, and the plastic-wrap-ish strip facing the top of the camera. Shut the back, now press the little button under the lens, which opens the lens and turns the camera on. Push the shutter button one time and the cover piece to the film will come out the top. Discard this. Now DO NOT OPEN THE BACK until the film canister is empty. You'll expose the film (got that from the instructions, too).Now just point and click. The photo comes right out the top... Pull it off but try not to touch the image. Within a few seconds you can see the image start to develop (always been the fun part of An instact camera!!)The one thing I hope they can improve in the future... The viewfinder is a little small. If i turn the canera for a horizontal photo, i have trouble seeing through the lense with my glasses on. It needs to be bigger.The photos are small (see my photos here for measurements... Darker ones were at twilight) and what you'd expect from and instant camera, but maybe better than I remember mine being, just a bit. Not digital quality but fast fun and fairly fabulous really! Not blurry. But i suggest you be pretty close to your subject... Play around with it a bit.I'm still planning to use my digital camera for most memories, but my hope is to take one or two instant photos on each trip and add those little photos into my scrapbook with my memorabilia. Then use my camera and computer to see the bulk of them.I suspect I'll buy another as a gift, too.:-)
Love this camera!  Easy to load the film and use.  The pictures are adorable and pop right out of the top of the camera.  The blue color is very pretty.
I got this Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 instant camera for my niece for her birthday.  I purchased the raspberry colored one and the color is a little bit darker in person, more of a red than a pink, it's still a really cute color.  This camera is easy to use and a lot of fun. I got my niece a selfie lens to go with it, she's turning 11 and so of course she wants to take a bunch of selfie's.  The camera is easy to use, and the pictures are about the size of a credit card. I think that my niece is going to have a lot of fun with this camera and I see a lot of film being purchased in the future.  Overall we are very happy with his camera and she loves it, so I would recommend it to anyone looking for an instant camera.
I love it
We bought this for a photo booth at my daughters graduation open house. Everyone loved it. Holding up picture frames in front of you and your friends,and taking silly pictures, was a total hit. You just have to realize the pictures are smaller in comparison to the old Kodak One Step, for those who remember that. I still have one with film, but with the new style and all the different colors, there was no way my daughter was going to let me bring that out. Lots of fun and works great.
My son loved it.
great camera
Such a good price for a good camera. Really liked this one.
The most fun (and cutest) way to take pictures. I took this with me on my trip to Washington to visit one of my best friends. I made a whole scrap book (over 60 pictures!). I took a whole bunch of pictures of my friends and family and hung them up around my room, it's a nice decoration. People always think its really cool when I take it out. I took some pictures with it when I went to Disneyland yesterday, it got an indirect compliment from Kylo Ren (he was impressed by the photographers use of "the force" when to picture rose out at the top and told him to join him in the dark side)!
I wasn't really aware of how small the photos would be. I thought they would be more like Polaroids than postage stamps. But it does take the photos.
So fun, so awesome. There is something about the candid feel of instant photos. My wife and I think it's nostalgic, our teenage kids think the pictures are lame but the function is fascinating. If you like the old school Polaroids, this camera will bring you back. Rated a 4 out of 5 because the film is so expensive.
Very cute little camera with a fun almost vintage but not quite feel. Easy to use and takes pictures that aren't very high quality but are fun to take at parties and give them out to your friends as gifts. This camera works very well and was much less expensive on amazon compared to other places I've seen such as urban outfitters (it was about 70 dollars and did not come with any film)
I used this for a photobooth for my girlfriend's bridal shower and it was adorable!
This is an awesome throwback! The picture takes a little while to pop out but everything else is great! I love instant cameras!
It does not work great at night what so ever. As well as outside in the sun. Pictures came out either black or super light unless it was taken indoors
I ordered this for my 6 year old photography lover. We got it with Amazon Prime, therefore it was delivered within two days. He was so excited! We opened the package loaded the film cartridge and he's been snapping pictures ever since. I would recommend this product to anyone, and would re order as well. Thank you Fujifilm for a great product.
very fun! I bought for my girl friend she aboslutely loved it.
Perfect for capturing life's moments. Love my instax camera!
Had great fun with this camera at my daughters birthday bash.  Hung pictures on a board her friend had made her during the party
I absolutely love the camera. It takes amazing pictures.
there is no where in the description, in the box or in the instructions saying FILM DOES NOT COME WITH IT? BUT BATTERIES DO? come on--that's crazy....so I got this for my daughter's birthday and she can't use it because now we need to order film for it? this needs to be somewhere in the description of the camera! boo! just include it so we can use the camera when we get it!
pictures not as good as a regular camera -- fun for my granddaughter
Absolutely love this camera! It is a little larger than I expected, its definitely not compact by any means. Prepare to have something to carry it in unless you dont mind carrying something around with you. Overall great product, super happy with the purchase.
LOOOVEEE this camera! It's cute, the color is LOVELY, and portable. It was exactly what I was looking for. The pictures is smaller than I expected, but it's a wonderful keepsake. Totally recommend.
the s wouldn't turn to 10 and when turned on the red light did not blink
Super cute camera! Perfectly good condition love it so much!
Product was shipped quickly, came in perfect quality. Great price. Wasn't disappointed whatsoever.
Great quality pics. It was a gift. My niece loved it!!
Absolutely love it, so much fun and easy to use.
Always Ben a fan of the Polaroid cameras growing up & this new version still brings me back! Love love love it!
absolutely love !
I have taken this to nearly every single trip I have gone since its purchase. It is an expensive camera at first, not really since I bought it at around 60 dollars. But on the long run, Film can be quite expensive. This camera just requires 2 double A batteries. You pop them in and wait for it to light up an automatic indicator telling you what lens to use and boom a great memorable polaroid. Although sometimes the light sensor can be tricked if you cover the sensor or other light is being shined at it, so consider your surroundings before setting the indicated lens. Also the only thing that would or should be changed would be where the preview lens is. It is awkward being on the side. No one tends to know where to look at first.
Exactly what my daughter wanted and works great!! Perfect for the tween amateur photographer:) Love this polaroid.
dont buy from this carrier, they are shady af
I love this camera , it isa peice you really have to own and the pictures are magnificent but make sure to put it on the correct setting
Good
I purchased this to use for our Polaroid guest book at our wedding. It was GREAT! We bought extra batteries but only need 2 sets for the whole night. Photos turn our clear and everyone had a great time with it. My grandmother used to have a Polaroid camera and we loved getting the photos instantly! I'm excited to keep this and use it for other parties!
My daughter thinks this thing is great.  Why anybody wants a modern day Polaroid camera is beyond me; and, just like the Polaroids, the photos are not nearly as good as what you can get with a digital camera or a smart phone. I guess instant photos are still fun.  Poor old Polaroid, if only they knew.
Bought for my friend and we had fun using it right away. So cute, makes a nice decor piece as well.
Nice little camera!
I don't know if it's how I'm taking pictures or if the camera is faulty, because the settings never seem to work for me. Other than that, the camera works perfectly.
I love this camera and I am so pleased with this purchase! It is very compact and lightweight so it is perfect for traveling to any location or event worth capturing on film. The color of this product is very true to the picture which was nice too! The settings are very easy to understand and there is a manual that comes with the camera which provides clear instructions on the best method for use. I would highly recommend this camera for anyone who is contemplating this purchase. You will love it and have a blast while capturing your memories! The price is awesome and I think it was definitely worth spending my money on!
Piece of crap, pictures are dark (even with flash).  Also, the camera broke after 6 months of minimal use.
My fiance loves this camera,  and was telling me she wanted this camera months in advance.  She was so excited when she got it.  She wish there was a mirror to take selfish but she actually found a accessory online and will be ordering soon
This is my favorite toy! It's a blast to bring anywhere. People get a kick out of it. Not to mention- that price is so low! I highly recommend.
Great product and an excellent price. Cheaper than big box stores when purchased as the whole kit. My daughter loves it.
What a great throwback to earlier times!!! Gave this as a gift to the wife and she loved it! In a digital day and age how cool to get the instant gratification from a physical photo to pass around and then throw on the fridge. Don't expect high quality photos but what it lacks in quality it easily makes up in fun!I knocked off one star for functional issues while trying to use the peep hole (what your look through to take the photo) and then trying to take the photo. They just don't fully work well together. Maybe it's my larger hand/fingers that cause the problem but none the less it was a little cumbersome. No biggie though as I'm looking more at the experience and not so much the final product.Great find and huge kudos for gift creativity!
Used this for graduation, takes longer to produce a picture than expected, but works well.
Takes really crappy pictures, like pinhole camera. Picture format is the size of a passport photo. Kids like this for a couple weeks, til they stuff it in a drawer and forget about it in lieu of the smartphone camera. The film is extremely expensive per picture. Construction seems to be above average. Actually, it's still somewhat of an engineering marvel, but its quality is very poor. But the optics produce pictures like something you'd expect from a happy meal toy. This is an expensive novelty item. I'd suggest looking for a used camera to satisfy the whim. Then, trade it to someone else.
98% of my photos came out completely black. I've tried many different packs of film now to see if maybe my film or lighting was the issue. The film is not the issue. It's too late for me to return this since I bought it in April, but I would definitely not recommend this camera! I'm truly disappointed since Polaroids are really fun.
Bought this camera for our 5 year old girl, she adores it. Takes it everywhere
Love these things, thanks.
This takes great pictures.
Love!!! Super fast, easy for kids to use!
My grand daughter loves the camera! She has to get use to how to set the settings......as the film is a little pricey!I haven't received the two year warranty protection that was suppose to come via E-mail that I paid from!!!!
Just what I wanted to get into film photography. Although buying film get be annoying and spendy. Actually holding the photo in your hand makes it even more special.
The quality leave's a lot to be desired.  Very Easy to use and if you aren't expecting more than a novelty fun device, this is great!
I love that polaroid pictures made a comeback. We took ours to Africa so we could leave photos for the orphans we were working with. You want to see a kids face light up give them a polaroid! :) But seriously it works exactly like you remember it. any easy load cartridge is inserted, you line up the shot in the window, and out pops the picture. I had to shake the picture for about 5-10 minutes before it fully developed. A couple never fully developed. Not sure what caused this exactly but I think that is normal. It obviously had to survive a lot of handling and adverse weather, and it handled it like a champ. I'm sure these are already a huge hit at weddings but they would also be great for parties if you setup one of those photo booth areas. You can buy this and be happy with the results. If this was helpful please Like the review. Thanks!
love it
Love the hello kitty film! The film is about the size of a credit card. Our daughter loves watching the film develope.
I've been wanting one of these for quite a while and I'm really glad I finally decided to buy one. They take very nice pictures and in the instructions it has a lot of tips to avoid out of focus or poorly lit shots. It's really nice to be able to take a picture and immediately have the physical copy!!
such a fun camera, and super easy to use
It gets all stars cause it's so great. Two of my friends had this at the last party I went to and I bought it while I was there. Came the next day (may not be the case for everyone) and I can't wait to use it. I got it in the Grape color and it's perfect.
Awesome camera!!! I bought it for my 10th year-old niece and she loves it!!!! Picture quality is great and loved the color!!!
my daughter is very excited
I love it so much. Mine doesn't give me any problems. It takes amazing pictures and is easy to handle.
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.
I love this Polaroid. I bought it for my graduation party but it is sturdy and looks like I can use it for much more. The white isn't tacky or plastic-y. Super cute and will make for some great memories!
I LOVE my little camera. It's so cute!
Bought this for my little sister and she LOVES IT!! Comes with everything you need to start taking some awesome instant photos! Jut make sure you buy the one that comes with film! Film is easy to install, photos are easy to take and the camera is great quality!I like bringing back the vintage vibes with this camera as it gives a nostalgic feeling when your photo instantly comes out of the camera!Great product!
The color of this camera is ugly, not as pictured and I returned it.
Love love love this camera! Only giving 4 stars because after taking 3 pictures with it the film started developing into just an all black picture. I did my research and this is a somewhat common defect of the Mini 8 cameras. I returned this camera to Amazon and they had sent me a new one in only 2 days!!! Amazing customer service I am beyond pleased!
Great little camera. Love the photos
This camera is super cute and takes great photos. Very easy to use, easy to load film, pictures turn out great. Had one that was black after taking it.  Love the grape color...all around great buy!
good product
Absolutely love it!!
It was broken when I got it. Will not turn on no matter how many batteries I try. Now I have to go through the trouble of using the warranty.
Awesome!
It gets shadey in the eyehole thing. When I bought this i was excited to take a bunch of pictures. It gets old after like 4 pics.
Still having trouble using this but I know when I read the "how too" book I will learn.I love it
Great product
Everything met my expectations
Super cute! As soon as the pictures come out I pin them above my bed. Lots of fun to use for all ages. Great gift
I ordered the raspberry color. Installation of film was simple and easy. Package comes with a string handle and 2 AA batteries. NOTE::film is sold separately unless stated its a bundle. The only con is that it's only 10 photos per film box so it gets pricey after awhile.
My camera came broken
Works great!
Perfect!
Okay, so I really like this camera a lot, my only issue being that it doesn't come with any film at all if you get the base version. Okay, shame on me, I should have read all of the customer questions in detail, but nowhere on the page does it actively say "film not included." Well, hopefully you're reading the reviews before you buy because the base camera does not include ANY FILM AT ALL. I didn't expect much, maybe just a starter pack of even five pieces just so you could at least test out the camera a few times without wasting film.Besides that, I think this is a wonderful camera! I've gotten so used to taking digital photos, that I almost never print them out anymore. This camera is the key to physical, tangible photo memories, perfect for a scrapbook or (in my case) my bulletin board at college. I can't wait to use this to make memories of my junior and senior years!
Thought it would come with the papers but looks lovely
I got my girlfriend this as a birthday gift and she loves this product and has been taking pictures non-stop! It's a little chunky, but she has a purse, so no worries there!
Overall a really great camera for 12 and 13 year Olds but there are a few downsides to this camera. The quality of the pictures is actually pretty decent but they are slightly blurred. And you have to center the lense not the viewer on the side. It cuts off half of the image. The color is almost exactly to what you see in the pictures and this is a really great birthday present for the price but if you're looking for a camera that will center the picture get the Polaroid snap the picture quality isn't very different but there are no worries about how the picture will turn out.
Love it!! So glad I got it, super fun
Love the color! Easy to use and works great. I've had it in my wishlist for quite a while, and finally happy that I decided to get one
I love my camera. It takes "fun size" photos at two different positions.  Just remember to set the lense for the proper lighting or you will be wasting a Polaroid as I have done.
Love it! Disappointed that turning the flash off is not an option. It washes out the photo in some lighting. Good for the price :)
Gift. She loved itm
love it
It's more of a red than a raspberry. Not too happy about that.
Daughter loves it
Fun and affordable camera for kiddos. We purchased this camera as a Birthday present for an 8 year old. What smash hit. The camera feels sturdy in your hand, not like a piece of cheap plastic. The buttons are larger so easier to push for smaller hands. The instructions were a little complicated but like any 8 will sit and read the instructions. A quick explanation of the camera by an adult and they were off taking pictures, nice ones too. The film brings back that nostalgia. In the camera case came the camera, the instructions and a wrist strap. It did come with two AA batteries. There was NO film with the camera as it says. We have had great clarity with pictures, even when the 8 year old is taking them.This is a super fun camera and you can buy a bunch of accessories to go with it, even a selfie lens! This is a very fun camera for younger kids and a would be a great camera for weddings, birthday parties, or any party.
I bought this for my daughter for her 8th birthday and she loves it!  Its good ol' fashioned fun.  A little sensitive to lighting, it took her 5 pictures or so to get the hang of it, but she loves it.
Kids are enjoying it..
My daughter loves this camera, especially the color.
excelent , thanks
my third one! gave the first away because I wanted a different color and the second one just broke this weekend (after so many years!). I love instant cameras!no filter was used for the pic. it's a true raspberry color not so much hot pink like I originally assumed.
Love this camera. The color is so cute, looks exactly like the picture and it's the perfect size
SUPER fun & amazing. Came a day early
Good
excellent!!
The pictures come out way to light!
The camera is beautiful and my teenager niece loves it (she's 12). It's very easy to use. I recommend to buy it along with the purple case, it protects the camera perfectly. Arrived as promised, which is something to brag about since international shipping tends to be an ordeal. The color is exactly as shown in the image.
Wasted a pack of 60 films with this camera, tried everything, it just wont develop!
Fantastic
It was great quality and did what I expected it to.
My preteen loves it! Well made product too!
Awesome gift
Fun! I bought this in a nostalgic phase. Reminds me of middle school. The pictures come out a little small for my liking, and the light setting can be a little tricky to figure out, which means you waste a few pictures trying to get the picture to come out right. That is annoying to me, as Polaroid film is expensive and it can add up quickly. Overall its a fun idea. I love the color and I use it occasionally. I don't use it as much as I would like because of how expensive the film is.
The camera was inexpensive compared to other places where these are sold. The pictures about the size of a drivers license. The camera takes good pictures except for in sunny areas.
Simply adorable
Love this, bought it for a friend.
This camara was above my expectations it's been working perfectly. I've already had it for a few months now and it hasn't had any problems. I put some of the pictures in my daughters lo jet and she loves it
Came in perfect condition and works very nicely!
It was working fine! And now when I turn it on it starts taking 2 pictures automatically! When I have film inside and when I don't. It already ate 4! I need a replacement!!!
My daughter has only used it once since I purchased it and the pictures are very nice and clear.
This is really fun for my 16 year old daughter.We gave it to her at her birthday party.She and friends liked taking pictures and having them readily available and watching them develop before their eyes.I think I am going to buying lots of FUJI film over the year and better invest.
I don't recommend to purchase as it wasn't working well within days and weeks later not at all. My very responsible 12 year old daughter was extremely careful when handling it and hardly used it. Her friends had the same problems. JUNK! I would recommend buying from a retail store where you can return if you have an issue.
We had so much fun with this camera!
Love this
A great camera for instant photos! Fairly easy to use and the picture quality is decent!
I wish I could give this a 10 star review.  I LOVE my instax. We bought it for our guest book for our wedding and I'm hooked.  I keep a constant supply of the film to take pictures of my daughter from the time she was born to every month picture,  her baby book, fun event,  birthday party,  i just can't get enough of it.  The only down side is that I wish I had spent the 10 extra dollars and gotten a colored one because white gets dirty so quickly.
This such a fun camera. I love having so many polaroid pictures.
fun fun fun
I absolutely adore this camera!! Works great, so cute, exactly what I was hoping for.
Loving my new Fuji Instax mini 8 camera!!!!  Perfect for parties, Selfies with old friends, etc.  I recently went to a baby shower where they had a pink one, because the mom was expecting a girl.  They created an album of photos people shot from it at the party!  How cool!I also bought the carrying case, so the photo shown has the bottom half of the case showing.  It is not included with the camera.  I will be having lots of fun with this baby!
My granddaughter loved it
Camera is NOT pink it's an ugly orange color...so sad I will be returning!!!!!!!
My wife loves it!
It's a wonderful camera
This is a fun camera and as someone who has always had some instant camera this one is perfect and fun
Very easy to use, pictures are great, the color is beautiful(i have the rasberry one)I recommend!!!
Our camera takes truly horrible pictures. while the flash goes off every time, their appears to be no light metering. The exposure is constantly way off and blurry. (most often overexposed) I realize most pictures are taken by my 7 year old's hyperactive hands but a flash is supposed to help compensate for that. Maybe we got one that has something wrong with it but I have only seen one or two pleasing picture out of hundreds taken..
Awesome camera !!! loving it !!
This is a wonderful instant camera. I have tried out other ones but the pictures do not come out that great. I love the size of the pictures and the style of the camera. Very easy to use.
BEST CAMERA EVER!!! Love this camera! Its the cutest thing i have ever owned! Its seriously the best and takes great pictures!!!!
its really cute and fun to have
Super cute camera to have; I think my favorite thing about it is actually having tangible photos for memories, also did include batteries !
I love the idea of instant photos for my scrapbook, but the photos where poor.  Seem like you can only use it in daylight if you want to see who is in the photo and If i took it in direct sunlight the pics where blurry.
some pictures ended out coming out blank and the lens was still open, and even if the camera is on it shouldn't let it take a picture.all though the pictures that worked came out pretty good!
I am so glad I bought it on Amazon, it comes with a protection plan but even after that, the total was still cheap. The camera is not too bulky but not thin as modern digital cameras. It does the job of taking pictures but I am still not used to working the flashes.
It came in perfect condition and it works great!! I highly recommend this camera!!
Amazing totally recommend buying best thing ever !
Nice little camera in a time where instants are harder to come by. The design is nice, with smooth sides and hand grips that make it comfortable in your hand. The photo quality is good but not excellent because it's sometimes hard to decide which lighting mode to put it in, but that's to be expected with an instant camera as they're more for the novelty than practicality. I've had mine for a little over a year and it still works as well as the day I got it.
My daughter loves it. Very good quality.
Simple, easy to use....great little pictures.
Half of the pictures are always black. Horrible product.
The camera itself works great. The only problem I had was I ordered the raspberry color, which looks like it's a fun pink color. It's not. The color that came out of the box was more like a burnt orange. It actually looks like it was super old and faded.  I wanted to send it back, but it was my daughters birthday gift and she was too excited to have it (although she did say the color wasn't her favorite - and still refused to send it back).
Can't wait to use on my trip, love how these photos come out
great gift
Soooo cute!  💕
Good gift for teen
I loved it, it works perfecly
So cute and fun to use.
I love it so much!
Love the thought of instant film again!
pictures are too small
I had my doubts about this camera based on some of the reviews I read, but it's actually pretty awesome. You hardly need the instructions to figure out how to put it together, meaning put in the batteries, put in the film, put it on the right setting for the lighting and shoot! My picture came out clear and of good quality for a polaroid. This is going to be so much fun to use at weddings and family trips, I'm really excited to have added this as one of my accessories besides my cellphone camera. The film is a little expensive, but it is not meant for taking as many pictures as you would on your iphone camera, I really will only be using this for special occasions anyway, but it would be nice if they could lessen the price of the film! Especially since it is so tiny (like others have said, the size of a credit card) but the camera is SO worth it for the price, and for the overall joy it brings to you and your family. If you have kids, they will absolutely love it too! Great buy. I will make sure to add photos later!
I love this camera
Love this camera!
Cute, compact, and super fun to use!! Love my new camera!
Super cute camera! Absolutely love it! The picture quality is not so great, but I guess that is kinda expected with Polaroid pics.
Beautiful camera, in great condition and the shipping was extremely fast!--Can't wait to use it.UPDATE: I love it so much! The Polaroid pictures are really cute and it's so easy to take them! Works like a charm.
This Camera did the best for me. Yes it might be confusing at first but once used it can just become one of your favorite things to do in your free time. If you're a person planning to want to get in taking photos and or want another camera to have fun taking pictures with this Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant could be right for you😊.
Used this for the guestbook at our wedding. Guest loved it and I haven't stopped using it since. Something unique compared to all the selfies.
SUCH A FUN CAMERA!  QUICK PICS FOR MY 8 YEAR OLD WHO LOVES PHOTOGRAPHY
my daughter love this! Thanks for a smooth transaction!
Awesome !!!
Good quality, cool throw back to days gone buy with the original Polaroid cameras.
Great product!
BUMBEB it didn't come w film but it's wonderful
Love it!
got this for my wife. she loves it
Ok this camera is everything to my daughter. Old school fun. Easy to work and not to big. Great fun!!!
My daughter adores this camera. A great gift option for tweens. Wish the film was more cost reasonable, otherwise great item.
Perfect, just as described.
Very good camera, I totally recommended.
Instant cute memories. Was a hit on vacation when I was able to give one of the locals photos to keep. They loved and appreciated it. Priceless.
Good
Perfect for traveling and for scrapbooking! I just love this camera.
just as expected
My daughter loved it!!!!
I love it.
SUPER CUTE ! LOVE IT! TOTALLY RECOMMEND AS A GIFT OR A PERSONAL CAMERA 💞 DELIVERY WAS SUPER QUICK, SUPER EXCITED the color is beautiful as well
Awesome camera.  Wish it was a little bit smaller and wish the viewfinder was I little bigger and easier to see.  But overall it works great and takes great pictures
I gave it as a gift and she loved it.
This camera is AMAZING! I just got it, and I'm in love with it! Takes great pictures!!
Bought this for my 13 year old granddaughter -- she was THRILLED!!
It's awesome....my daughter loves it!!!
Sometimes, the camera acts up but it's so simple and easy to use!
love this little instant camera. its so cute and works as well as the large size just in mini size.
it works
Excellet produtc, working perfectly and is the cutest thing ever! Complete and easy, arriving before I expected (in half of the time) is perfect in every way~
Takes nice picturess
I had a little hard time to figure it out, but it was good and instructions were clear.
So cute!! Love it!!!
great product A++++
I bought this camera for my teenage daughter for her birthday, she didn't think she would use it due to her frequent "selfie" photography habits but I was gladly mistaken when she quickly re-ordered more film from Amazon the next day, film with some special effects and a regular batch.  I'm glad I introduced her to this retro hobby and she has some photos to display of her friends and animals, not just her "selfies"
I love love love.
I love this camera.  The pictures come out crisp and vibrant (more than I expected) we cant wait to use this at our wedding!!  Works great.  Packaging was damaged as described but none to the camera inside
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AWKJPOA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0camera doestnt worck, camera damaged,please help contact to seller!!!! all pitures black
I bought this on a whim. Me and my boyfriend have been together for 9 years and living together for 3. One night I woke up and realized that we did not have any pictures of us or the dogs!!! [we never take picture with our phone since we both have the bad luck of getting our phone stolen or lost and digital cameras are so expencive to have pictures printed out.This camera is small and awkward and you can't turn off the flash or else the picture comes out distorted. If you wear glasses it's going to be a bit of a pain. I keep clacking my glasses against the eye hole when I try to take a picture but it works! The pictures come out decent, like those old time photos. Would recommend if your just looking for a few wallet size pictures to keep around.Or some cute dirty pictures you can have around without the fear of someone finding them while looking at your phone!
Great.
Better price
Very good my dtr loved it
Happy with the performance for what it is.  But plastic melts easy. Cord melted into the camera and it was not even in the hot sun. We are not sure what even happened. Was very odd.  Battery case was fine.
Love this camera
Nice quality camera, pictures are perfect. low price!
Bought this for my daughter's 10th birthday on a whim and she absolutely loves it and the idea of the instant photos.  I decided on the Fuji over Polaroid based on the cost of the film.  The accessories available are very fun too!
I bought this for my daughter's 15th birthday and it made her sooooo happy!  It takes great pictures (but be warned, they are MUCH smaller than the old polaroids we used to have).  She has so much fun with the accessory pack I also purchased with it (Mudder 11 in 1 Camera Accessory Bundles Set).  My friends and I (we are in our mid-40's) also had fun during a reunion.  I highly recommend this for any teenager for sure!!!
So the package came on time and it was nicely packaged and great condition! I'm usually uneasy with online purchases but this was worth it. I got the raspberry color one and it looks exactly like the first image. The color is like that image. Also, I can't stop looking at the camera! It's so nice and smooth and almost too perfect to use. I'll recommend this if you want one of these cameras!
Love this color,and the camera is really fun, my class loved it
Pretty color camera and it takes good quality pictures!! Used this at our wedding and it was a big hit!
It's super cute, and the pictures are fun to take! The one drawback is that the pictures all have a misty filter. The filter can cause some features of someone's face not to show up in certain lighting, which happened to me. When taking a picture, don't face the sun or away from it. Try to take your picture from a well-shaded area. Film is kind of expensive, too. $1 per picture.Fun: 5/5Function: 4/5Price: 4/5
Good
LOVE this camera. wanted to do a Photo Booth for an event, but couldn't afford the nearly $600 to rent one for just 2 hours. So I purchased this and had guests put their photos into a guestbook. It was a huge hit and so much fun!
cool and fun
The camera worked fine. The lights on the lense did not work.
Got four of these for my bridesmaids and they loved them!
Used for a wedding photo guest book. Unique and fun way to honor bride & groom
Bought this for our 12-year old daughter, and it's a really neat camera. She's in love.The instructions to set it up and start operating are easy to read and follow, which we appreciated, so she could do it on her own.Also, it came WITH BATTERIES. Unheard of, and completely awesome. Thank you for making this really easy to get going with -- what all kids want with their new presents :)
The coolest little thing I've ever owned, absolutely love this camera!
The cutest little thing ever. Lightweight and fun to use. I have had it for almost a year, got my friend one as a present as well. Both have been working great. Just wish film was cheaper to buy as you go through them so fast. Great for travel journals.
fine
Chic and cute
I really love it , pictures are very clear !
My daughter received the camera as a Christmas present. She loved the idea of an instant film camera and she loved it. Fast forward to this summer, where the instant pictures rarely turn out. .
The color was not as shown....the little girl who picked it out was so unhappy as it came more in the order of Salmon color
Great as a beginner camera to get you into instant photography! However I've only had it 3 1/2 months and I already feel like I need to upgrade.
I have looked everywhere for this camera. Went to NY but was a lot more also Michael's is pretty pricy and so is the film. Can't go wrong with Amazon prices!
This is a classic polaroid camera. So many times my pictures hide on a memory disc and I forget to print them. There are light settings in front which are pretty self explanatory. I took this to the beach a few times and even in that brightness the pictures turned out great. You can get 4 people in a selfie easily: just have the person with the longest arms at the end holding the camera. Have someone else peer through the view finder and adjust then squeeze back in the picture!
Lovely addition to my photographic gear. Everyone loves the pictures and the size is perfect to carry them in your wallet. It is somewhat hard to take pictures when there is to much light, but other than that, it is a great camera.
this was great ! it came right when it was supposed to come.
I love this camera! It works perfectly and it's so adorable!
Great camera.The only sucky part is that the flash goes off even when it's not necessary.Still trying to figure out how not to let that happen...
Cool little camera for young photographers. Easy to operate and fun!
Bought this as a gift for my 24 year old daughter.  She says it works perfectly, and she loves the small format print size.  The only drawback is that the film is a little pricey.  Also, there is no digital copy of the photo made.  Once the picture is taken, you only have the instant photo.  But my daughter really likes it.
Love this little camera, I can't wait to use it for my wedding guest book!
I brought this camera for my little sister who is 9 and she loves it ❤️
It is great but the film is very expensive
good
Don't expect the quality to compete with smart phones but used properly, this thing is actually wonderful. My old polaroid has very expensive film so this "new" fujifilm works well for me. The price is right, the memories are capture, it's in my favorite color, and I love learning the varying exposures to this type of photography. Excellent product.
This camera is worth buying. It is amazing that you can capture a moment and  immediately have it there to look at.
My teenage daughter loves taking pictures on this digital camera. Fun and retro.
Daughter loves it!  Film is expensive so she doesn't get to play with it as much as she would like.
I bought this is a gift, so I didn't really used it myself. But I took picture with one before. It is a nice camera for an instant photo. It is really fun also.
Love it!
Camera is tons of fun for teen, preteen girls (maybe boys too, I don't know!)
Love it
Super fun and easy to use, the film is a bit pricey but the pictures come out super cute!
I loved it I loved it I loved it !!!
Good
I LOVE IT!!! I love the black color but keep it out of the sun because it will get really hot, and make sure you put your finger over the flash if your taking a picture of something white or it will all be white, and to get the best results put in a dark place
In love with this would but again
the delivery was on time  , and nice product for sharing memories
Love it :)
This camera is a lot of fun! Super easy to use & great quality photos.
Exactly what I  wanted! Super cute little Polaroid camera, not high quality pictures, but adorable and a good deal for the price.
Love this!!!!!
Works great!
This little camera is just the most fun thing! It's a blast to use, but even more exciting is the quality of resulting images. The colors are deep and rich, lending the photos that much more authenticity. This is so much better than Instagram.
works good
My daughter loves this camera! Perfect for young teenager girls!
My son loves it, gives him a chance to express his funny side!!!
Love the camera, feels cheap but actually takes nice photos if your close range
awesome! love it :) came right on time
It was defective so I got a refund.
Adore my new camera! Much nostalgia! Love having actual pictures in my hands again!
Cool camera, quick output. Too bad the viewfinder is so small.
Awesome product
Super cute, lightweight, and so far takes great (at least as great as I expected) photos.  Easy to load film, nice indicator for which light setting to use.  Plan on taking this to Burning Man to "gift" photos, and will likely use for fun party giveaways over the holidays.  Would be great for kids, birthday parties, or if you wanted to spring, on each table at a wedding reception.  Saw someone said they used this with their guest book...would be very cute.
great
Amazing camera! Just as described!! I love love it! Cute and so much fun!! I'm very pleased with this product!!
SO much fun to use!!
This is a coolest little camera like the old Polaroids! All the directions were in Non-English but pictures were well enough. My 10 year old got this for her birthday and loves it! The pictures turn out pretty good too!
A very very good camera, worth ever penny!!!
Very Fun
My six year old daughter wanted a camera for her birthday and saw this one and it was perfect although film is rather expensive it was worth the price and she loves it.
PERFECT Camera!!
LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS CAMERA! The color is beautiful, the camera is easy to work and even includes different light settings. You turn it on just by pressing the button on the side of the lens and turn it off by pushing in the lens. The camera feels extremely durable and my pictures come out so cool!
I'm in love with my new camera. I now need to get a carrying case for it. I was hesitant because I've never used one before. It was the best! The price is absolutely amazing. It's way expensive if bought in stores. Get it here now!
I bought this as a bday gift for my daughter. We took 2 pictures with it. She then put it away for a couple weeks. When she brought it out to use again it was completely dead. We put in fresh batteries and still nothing. Now we have to ship it to fugifilm if we want it fixed.
Love it. Really clear pictures and great price for how much you can use it
Cute and very novel. The pic quality is less than the "polaroids" of old. They are about 3 inches tall but if you are looking for something that is a fun little gift, this would do it.
I loveee'
Everything was perfect!
So in love with it already! ☺️☺️☺️ Just wish the eye hole was a litttttle bit bigger but oh well I still love it :)
I bought this as a baby shower prize. But it was given at the end so I used it with the film to give every guest a chance at taking home a picture. It was a hit. Mini, maybe a little small but people vied for the prize at the end. It got its use, a winner was happy and guests had a take home momento. It was much cheaper than a picture booth!
A hit at every party! So much fun, and now my fridge is covered with great party photo's. Its light and small enough to take out as well.
Daughter loves it!
I love my new camera! It's so fun and the pics come out looking very vintage! Great for using in art journals and collages!
bought it for instant pictures and so far it has not disappointed me. learn how to take pictures in different lighting first. there are lots of Youtube videos on how to take best pictures. Buy the films in bundle from Amazon and you will save big on films.Happy shooting
I had to get a new one because my first one shot out film whenever I turned it on, but I love it and they take great pics.
perfect !
Amazing cheap polaroid
Love it
Its awesome
It was a gift to my daughter. She loves it
Gahhh, this camera is so cute and small! I was given many compliments the first day it came (which was early today). The camera came a day before the estimated time arrival, so I'm so glad. I had bought a bundle which included the camera, a film pack (20 films), and a clear plastic case with an adjustable colorful strap. Film can be quite expensive; ranging from 11.59 to 12.48 just for a pack of 20 (also called the twin pack). You should be wise about taking a picture unless you have ALOT of film. I just purchased 2 more boxes of film which are coming in the first week of August.Pros:-Very cute-Small (the smaller, the better it is to carry around!)-Can be used with lots of accessories; stickers, carriers, etc..)-Quite simple to use!Cons:-If you're not familiar with these types of cameras, you would probably need to go online and find directions/tips because the instructions that came with the camera weren't that clear-A little fragile, so you have to be extra careful when using itSo far, the camera was so worth the price! I hope you enjoy your new FujiFilm INSTAX mini camera! :)
Fast delivery and just what we wanted.
So happy I bought these cameras for my daughters their 5 & 6yrs old and its super easy for them to use! I love the picture quality and the size is perfect for a our little memories we share.  You have buy film separate but u can get good deal on AmaZon 40 pics for $26! So it's great deal for us . Everything works great , if I were you buy this camera you won't regret it !!!:-)
Fun gift for teens.
Great camera!  Takes great pictures . My daughter loves it .
Just what my granddaughter wanted!
My kids love it.
It works sometimes and then sometimes it doesn't want to work.
Okay, but doesn't take good pictures at night.
Love it!!  Worked great!!  Wonderful memories!!
I've been eyeing this camera for the past year on another site (a popular clothing store) and when I found it on Amazon, I decided to buy it. The camera arrived within two days and it was exactly what I was expecting. Everything was in the box and in perfect condition. Beyond being happy with the shipping and the overall condition of the item, I just love it. The white Fujifilm Instax Camera is cool, adorable, and reminds me of the cameras we had as kids in the 80s. I haven't used a non-digital camera or smartphone camera (iPhone) in years, so it's fun to have a camera that (1) isn't digital and (2) prints out real, tangible photos instantly, which can then be displayed, placed inside an album, or shared. Added bonus is the white space where one can write info about the photo like who, what, when, and where, just like we used to on Polaroids or on the backs of photos. It's a great way to make memories and I love the style of these mini photos. I know these cameras are popular among young people, but I think they have a timeless quality that anyone can appreciate.
Works perfectly and came on time ! Thank you !
Really happy with the previous version of this camera but the settings of this newer version seem to set themselves and cannot adjust the flash manually. I have taken photos outside which turn out distorted because I cannot turn off the flash.
I love the little camera, just what I expected but 1st day I got it the lens cover popped off. I put back on but is not fitting securely.
Great camera. Easy to use. Daughter loves it.
loved it!
The best
Takes decent pictures inside, not so good outside
Excellent camera for a photo booth. We used this at my husband's birthday party to let guests take pics as sort of a photo guest book. The photos came out well, and it made for a fun time as well as a nice keepsake.
love it! true to color. takes good pictures and fun to use.
Cute camera.  Really does the job.  I use the photos to make photo groupings.
Love this camara. Cheap and good.
Adorable and works very well. I like the auto flash and all the settings. It seems durable and everything is in working order (the lights, film countdown, flash, etc). I hope it lasts!
10/10 exactly what I expected takes clear and pretty pictures
Nice and cute
Bought this for my teen daughter, she is loving it.
I love this camera! It takes some time getting used to how to properly use it, but I was surprised to see the quality of the pictures. I have taken more than 30 pictures so far, and with the exception of a couple of pictures, they turned out great. One thing I have noticed is that the light settings indicator above of the lens can be sensitive in times of clouds and high light. So make sure you have the dial turned on the right light before the picture.It's fun, fashionable, and very light to carry. I do recommend a purse/case to hold your camera and some extra film. The purse my girlfriend has been using for the camera is the "CAIUL Instax Mini First Generation Zipper Universal Camera Case", and it has more space to hold other belongings. One last recommendation is the wallet album  for the photos; unless you plan to have the pictures organized in some type of collage, the wallet album is a perfect way to store them.
fun
It's really good and I love it
Like
It was aright
I had a Poloroid camera as a kid that I loved, so I decided to give this one a try. The pictures are slim and smaller than the old school instant cameras. The picture quality is heavily based on which light setting you select. The fickle lighting setting is truly the only downside the the camera, but after some practice I have gotten better at selecting the right setting.
Great product! One of my friends had this during a bachelorette party and it was a major hit! That weekend I went online and purchased this Polaroid camera! I have had it now for about a year and a half and still use it without any problems!! At first it took some figuring out as far as which setting to use to get the look of the picture I wanted but after playing around with it am very satisfied!!
I had always wanted a polaroid camera. The camera IS SO CUTE AND HANDY when you're traveling. I love how you can take pictures anywhere and it comes out right away. The cameras really cheap but the only bad thing is how the film cost so much. I recommend buying 100 packs of film so the films would be cheaper. But I STILL LOVE HOW THEY DEVELOPED THE PICTURES SO FAST
fun camera.  easy to use.  wish the film was less expensive.
We bought a couple for a party, we had a photo guest board rather than a book guests sign.  It takes a bit of time to get the photos lined up but within a couple shots we had it down.  When outdoors during daytime don't use flash as they may look overexposed and you'll waste film.  The power button is not obvious but overall we were very pleased with these and they were very convenient.  The film, size is small so not like the old 70's polaroid's but yet small enough to put in your wallet if you wanted.
LOVE this camera!  I grew up in the 80's and 90's and used a few different versions of the Polaroid camera -- which were such a phenomenon in the days when you couldn't see the photos you took before getting a roll of film developed.  The instant photo hasn't lost its thrill, even though digital cameras are now the norm.  Love this for taking fun, spontaneous photos and still getting to be surprised at what develops!
Perfect camera for the perfect moments. I recommend to take pictures during the daytime when the lighting is great, dark pictures still come out but not as great as day light ones.
Awesome camera. My son loves it. It works just like the old Polaroid cameras from when I was a kid, but the pictures are about half the size.
The camera itself is very cute, about photo quality i been able to take very nice photos when the day light is good but the sun is not very strong, even though it has the filters and flash i wont recommend using it when is too dark or at night because it only captures the nearest and lighters objects, other than that we need to remember is a instant photo so the resolution is not perfect but you can get very nice pictures.
I love this product!
Super cute camera! I get a ton of compliments! I adore the color of this camera
I bought this camera for my daughter's birthday for her and her friends to take pictures in a "photo booth" with props. It was a HUGE hit! Using the camera is beyond easy, and her friends could take their pics home. Definitely recommend!
I love this so much!
Nice product for the price.  Pretty and simple...good design.
The camera was a hit at my kids birthday party.
I love this camera! There's something very nostalgic about using a "instant" camera and the bright yellow color is so cheerful!
I'm absolutely in love with this camera it meets all of my expectations I actually got this camera on the 21 of July and its stunning takes great vintage looking photos perfect for all occasions its a great price my total was nothing to what retail is  and I got the camera the case and two packs of film so it's so worth it
Loved it was amazing to plenty of pictures with it going to need more film but definitely really good product to use my friend loves her camera best product ever have to say.
My daughter loves this.  Hard to believe the insta-matic is coming back. In the age of digital, the excitement of taking a picture as an instant tangible memory is contagious.
Great Camera ~ love it to pieces
my son loves it
granddaughter loves it
awesome old school but new school Polaroid camera best buy also comes in different colors
Bien cool
The camera came defect where the exposer light isn't changing to a different setting. Everything else is perfect though!
Got this for my 26 year old daughter. She liked it but it isn't really practical. She had some fun with it but got bored with it. I bought one for my 15 year old also and the same thing...fun for a while but bored with it fast.
Film not included
Absolutely LOVE this camera
Thanks!
this is rarely out of my daughter's hands...a great buy.
Big hit at my daughter's first birthday party! So much fun!
LOVE this camera! It takes a little getting used to the different settings, especially in the sun! This is my favorite new toy!
It came in very quick in two days of me ordering it looks perfect
great for kids
I bought this for a friend's 18th birthday to surprise her (along with packets of film) and she LOVED it. It's perfect for summer break - to capture memories with friends - and can become a really cute DIY wall decoration too. Definitely purchase this for a teen's gift if you don't know what to get them. High quality too.
Best thing I have investided in, you're pictures come out Instantly instead of having to go somewhere and pay to take them out of a different camera
I purchased this camera for my 14 year old. My daughter and her friends love it! I admit I want one too!
Real cool for those of us who had the original in the 80s.
The pictures are smaller than I imagined, and the film is expensive at my local store, but it's great and I love it.
Love it!!! I was so excited to get it! It came in way faster than it was supposed to, but I'm not complaining!  I love how the pictures come out. They look like the old polaroids. Worth my money and its cheaper here than it is in store
Granddaughter loved it
I adore this camera! It's so much fun and very easy to use, as long as you read the directions and properly understand how to use the automatic light sensor. I got it expecting to take basic pictures with it- nothing fancy, and it has exceeded expectations. My 4 year old can use it with no issue, and I love that I can teach her basic photography skills with it. The pink color is super adorable too.
Love it!!
I love love love this camera.. Always a hit no matter where I am people love getting little photos as a gift=)
Very cute fast shipping
I gave it to my cousin for her birthday and she absolutely loved it!
Make my wife really happy and the vacation was much more fun with the memories!
NA
REcommend 100%
So easy to use! And impressive not only with speed of capture but clear crisp quality of photos! Our tween loves it!
was a gift but she loves it! Love the instax series.
Love using this camera. My husband and I used it at our wedding (the guests had their photo taken and then placed it in the guestbook along with their message/signature) and several times since then (honeymoon, graduations). It's always a popular hit.
obsessed. completely suggest getting one of these
Oh you hipsters and trying to bring the polaroid back to popularity. I actual like it. Finally something that is cool but not pretentious. The camera works great and the build quality is good. It was easy to use and a huge hit at the party.
I just love this so much!
The camera worked so well for the dyi photo booth at my sister's wedding. The guests loved the camera, and the pictures looked great.
One of the gifts for a granddaughter's graduation.  She really loves it.  Some of her friends already has it so she knew exactly how  it works.  Also picked up some film packs to get her started immediately.  It's kind of a fad throwback thing in her girl group.  Easy to use.  She is 13 and was taking snaps in 5 minutes.
I bought this camera for my grandaughter.  She loves it and has recommended it to all her friends.  I would highly recommend purchasing this camera.  It was a great price and fast shipping.
I purchased for my 12 year old niece who requested it for her birthday.  She loves it, so I guess that makes it perfect!
We gave this to our granddaughter as a birthday present to use in camp.  Seems like so many of the kids have one.  The prints are credit card size and good enough for use a fun camera.  Don't expect crystal clear prints -- that's not what this is about. Keep in mind that the film is not inexpensive but neither was Polaroid film.
Was a birthday present for my 14 year old niece. She loves it, but goes through film like crazy
Takes awesome pictures! Easy to load film, easy to use. I am in love with this camera! Cheaper to buy here than in the store! Amazing shipping! Got here 2 days earlier than expected :)
This has been fun for my daughter to use. Cute!
I absolutely love my new Hello Kitty instax camera !!! I got it in time for my birthday tea party and it was super beautiful !! I was a little bit concerned about the size, but trust me, when you receive it, you stop thinking about it because it was so adorable !!! I received so many compliments on it, I know you will love it !!!
Got it yesterday! I had a polaroid before but when the film was gone it was too expensive to get more, I'm very glad i decided to get this, it's perfect for art journaling!
Very cute present and looks great. It's a different shape from the regular instax cameras.
I was more than satisfied with this camera!! The color is super cute and high quality the pictures come out super duper cute! I also bought the matching case!! Love love love!!
My 7 yrs old niece loved it at her birthday party. Took pictures of everyone. Easy for kids to use. Also bought the photo album which she immediately put the photos in. Good quality photos
I received this camera as a gift for my birthday, and I absolutely love it. The authentic feel of physical photos within seconds is very fun and nostalgic. The film and other accessories don't burn a hole in my pocket either! I may even order more colors. Love!!
Good - just what I wanted!
Fun camera works great
Totally obsessed with my Instax camera! I use the Mini because I use the photos in my Midori Traveler's Notebook and these are perfectly sized! I also like that the camera auto-detects what lighting I need. The film is really easy to install as well, just open from the seal and pop it in-- make sure the yellow little marker is faced upwards!
This was her favorite gift for her birthday. She loves having pictures to show instead of just on her phone.
Classy way to revisit nostalgia! I love this camera!
Absolutely beautiful!!!
Love it! Thank you!
I love this camera. I didn't realize it was wallet size.. my fault. The pictures don't come out that great in bright sunlight settings.
So I'm completely in love with my camera. The pictures are so cute and it works great for little gifts at parties and stuff. The only downside though is that I've had this camera for 2 years now and I don't know why but the red light on the back that is supposed to go away and the orange one in the front is supposed to turn on so you know it's ready to take the picture? Yeah...it stopped working. So now every time I want to take a picture I have to constantly open and close the lens until the red light finally leaves. This is very heartbreaking for me because you know when you want a picture and that moment is kinda you know very special? Well this defect ruins that moment. Hopefully I can send it to the company in FL to get it fixed :(
I bought this Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 for my 12 year old granddaughter! She absolutely loves it and hasn't put it down since she got it 4 days ago!This camera reminds me of the 'Polaroid' camera days when you couldn't wait to see the photo develop! This is the same premise but this camera is so much smaller than it's former counterpart! It fits in my granddaughters hands perfectly, it has an automatic exposure measurement feature that  signals the camera to the recommended aperture setting so the user can manually adjust the dial to the recommended setting so your photos come out perfect!This camera seems pretty durable, is easy for her to use and it takes small, but nice photos. We both love this camera and would recommend it to others.
Perfect
It's is not a pink as it looks online and on the box. It's a more faded pink. If the flash is broken all of your photos will turn out black. My flash was broken and I had to return it. The pictures it takes are smaller than the size of your palm. I wish the photos were bigger. I ended up purchasing a new one from Michaels because I needed it before I could get the return processed. It takes decent photos, when the flash works, and it is a lot of fun to have.
Cutest thing ever! Works great. I love it. Comes with wrist strap and instructions
My teen loved this gift! A nice little flash back to old school Polaroid.
I liked the camera, I think it's a little big but works great
ITS REALLY CUTE. Bought this because I'm going to Otakcon in August. It's a lot bigger than I expected but that's cool.
I bought this for my wife, it's cute novelty item. The films can get expensive. It's basically prints out a smaller cuter version of the old school polaroids. My wife likes it and that's all that matters
I'm obsessed with it. Absolutely obsessed. Perfect size to take places!
It's amazing and  it came faster than expected to arrive I love it ❤️
My daughter loves it
Pictures are small but otherwise good
Overexposed. Poor quality. I guess what can you expect for 60 bucks.
I love this camera. Every time I take it out to snap photos I receive lots of compliments. I love the vintage look of the photos it produces. The varying flash settings are also pretty awesome. It takes a little practice in order to produce a photo with a centered subject, but once you master it you'll be good to go.
Nice
I didn't take any photo, but it's beautifull..
It came in good condition, it's been 8 months and it still works :) I'm very happy I bought this camera. My biggest fear was having to find the film but it's a great little camera :)
I can't stop saying how much I love this camera. I've always loved photography as I went to an art school but I was getting bored by digital photography. A friend of mine bought this one and as soon as I saw it, I knew I had to buy it too. The film is expensive (50 cent per film average) but totally worth it. I love this camera and the pictures it takes.  it's a easy and fun way to be remember by someone: Just take a picture of them (or with them) and writes a little note on the white blank space. The size of the pictures is awesome too (as big as a credit card) and it fits perfectly on a wallet. Best camera ever!!
Instant fun, great for parties.
Pros: Easy to operate, good quality photos, durableCons: Hard to reload film, loud picture taking
useful
Good quality , sturty design. It has even held up to a couple accidental drops. Does best with close up photos.  My only complaint is that the film is pricey.
Made a great graduation present! My niece absolutely loved it and started using it almost right away.  Was so much fun watching her use it.
Amazing camera for creating kids album, u will save time.
Love this camera. Works great.
Love everything about this product
I have no other words for this more than "I freeking loooove this cameraa". It's so beautiful, and takes great shots with great quality at a great price. It reminds me of old polaroids shots.
I love my little would be "Polaroid".I use this whenever i want to capture memories. Most recently, i used it at my sister's baby shower; i took a lot of great shots!
Perfect girly picture
My daughter loves it. The film is a little pricey but it is better in the bulk packs. There have been no problems with it. We bought it 6 months ago. I wanted to wait to review it untille we had it for awhile. Its been great with 6 months of hard use.
I really like it. Simple to use and sturdy camera body, most of all, picture quality is much better than I expected.
Guys ITS WORTH THE MONEY! The camera is so pretty but the quality is amazing. It comes with batteries and a strap. It's super easy and cute i honestly love it, if your looking for something cute with a little bit of a vintage style this is perfect. I got the blue one and it's amazing
Great for taking quick snap shots to share with friends.
This camera worked great and was a lot of fun to use for the first year and a half that I owned it. Since then, however, I've been unable to get it to power on. I've bought multiple packs of batteries and tried different brands, but have not been able to use the camera for about 6 months now. It is of course now out of warranty. I wish I had known that the Instax Mini has such a short lifespan, because I've got a box of the pricey film now that I can't use.
Saw this at a birthday  party, it's very user friendly. Bought one for my very young niece who's enjoying taking instant pictures. Especially  on her Disney vacation. The accessories  are adorable. The film has cute edges, there are albums, cases, I'm thrilled with it.
I love this toy-like camera! Color is cute and easy to carry.
Fun little camera. The flash is a bit bright so I put masking tape over part of it. We used it to make "put passes" for pur Cub Scout Pinewood Derby.
I think this camera is great! It's a great way to keep memories. I saw some bad reviews, which I don't know why because it works perfectly for me. Just make sure the camera is in the right light setting or it won't turn out great! You just gotta know how to use it.
I use this camera every chance I get and it hasn't disappointed. It's fun and turns out great pictures. The only thing I recommend is that the photographer get closer to the subject. The viewing lens tends to make things appear closer than they are and when the picture is taken, things are farther away. I would highly recommend this product. I get compliments and everyone loves it when I use it. It just seems so curious to everyone.
Love it
It has not worked right at all. We thought it was a setting or the film but it takes terrible pics. Needs to be replaced think it's defective.
Cute but only for indoor uses.  Overexposed in bright outdoor areas.
Super cool and exactly what I expected it to be. Now, I can pretend to be relevant on the internet.
I love my new Fujifilm camera so much!! But I have one concern.  When I look through the little window, before taking a picture, I make sure that I have, what I want to be centered, in the little black circle.  But, when the film prints out, the picture is not centered at all.  When I took a picture of a small dragonfly and printed the film out, the dragonfly wasn't even in the picture.  Any suggestions?
It is great.  I love it
Great Purchase, Fast Service
I like the cute little pictures but I miss the old polaroids better. The photos it prints are tiny and there's only 10 photos per pack of film. Not a real money saver considering how pricey each roll of film costs.
My daughter absolutely loves this little camera. The pictures are pretty good quality and the camera itself is pretty sturdy and well made.
con: the film is expensive
I purchase this camera for my wedding to do my own photo booth booth idea. It has work great i have used it before the date, just to get a familiarized my self with it. The pictures are the size of a business card with white borders. I like the quality overall i think i would continue to use it long after the reception. I really like that you have to think out the photo, before you just aim and shoot at anything like the old days, and you instantly get a print of it, great for sharing or like in my case, I chose the color white it looks very chick, The only think i wish the fils were a bit cheaper.
It doesn't really take good photos.
Bought as a gift for my daughter.  My daughter loves it.  Product was exactly as advertised.
Bought for my daughter's 8th birthday and she's in love with it!
Love the product exactly as explained!  Got it in 2 day very good shipping
You can not take a photo outside when there is sun.  Overexposed.  OK for indoors.
Beautiful camera! The color is slightly more pastel than the photo, but it is lovely. It came with batteries and a user manual for instructional use.
Love this camera. It's really fun and great for trips. The picture quality is a little bit unreliable at times but otherwise great! Love the yellow color. It's a soft pastel color.
great
It didn't work..all Lightsigns are plinking and I think I should return it. Many others claim the same thing.
Love this camera .. So much fun and photos come out awesome
save your money and do not buy this.
This was a present for the grand daughter and she loved it.
I purchased this for my daughter for her upcoming birthday.  I also purchased a accessory bundle and film so that she had everything for her little photography start.  I love the color of this camera, it's her favorite color.  It's easy to use and fun for instant photos.  She is going to love it!
Got it for someone as a gift and they loved it. Highly recommended.
Fun camera for my 5 year old. User friendly
Very difficult to take decent pictures with. I'm disappointed.
love it! hit at parties!
great camera, very cute and easy to use. it is slimmer than the mini7 but I find that it is actually harder to hold because they took the large rounded grip off of the body in order to slim it down. Still I haven't dropped it, I just feel less confident holding it (because I'm not always graceful) but it does come with a wrist strap so if you did drop it, it will just dangle from your wrist. because its an instant camera with flash it is prone to over exposed photos so just be aware of lighting before deciding to take a photo. That being said it takes better pictures in the daytime than in the nighttime even with the exposure and flash. still very happy with it!  it is less expensive, cuter, and easier to carry than the instax wide. the photos are a little smaller than an old school polaroid but till big enough.
So pretty and I works really well! Super cute
My teenager daughter loves it! Quality is good.
I love this camera. It is so much fun to have an instant print when spending time with family or friends. The color is a little bit on the pink size than on the red which is a bummer because I love red but other than that I love it!
Its a really great camera.
Thank you
It's dope
i freaking love this already. just buy it. do it.
Love it!
Bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas present. Loved it, we use it all the time. Great quality.
I LOVE my instax. It is super cute and fun. I take photos of my kids all the time, using it to capture little moments that I don't care to share with the world on social media. I love the reddish/pink color, and it has been lots of fun figuring it out. It has various settings, which I really need to learn because the one photo I took in noon sunshine was completely washed out and showed nothing. It's a fun camera, though, and I am loving it.
I can not rave about how much I enjoy shooting with this camera. I am in school getting a bachelors in photography and this camera comes everywhere with me. I love using it with friends so at the end of the night we all have a physical photo we can hang on to. I can't say enough about how much I love this camera. Just make sure you use your settings correctly and you will get some nice shots!
Bought for my 13 year old daughters birthday and she loved it!
I've been wanting one of these for a long time and I finally got it! It's amazing, great pictures, camera is small and light, color (grape) is super cute. It came in perfect conditions also, I got 0 complains on this product. 5 ✨well earned!
Great item
Love the vintage feel to this camera. Used it on 4th of July and although the fireworks I captured didn't turn out so great, the people I captured did. The key is to use it within the range of the flash during night time pictures. The cost to replace the film can get somewhat expensive, but I think I'll keep this for special occasions.
My friend got one of these and we all loved it so much that 5 of us also got it! Something so magical about Polaroid cameras. Takes surprisingly nice pictures. The only problem I had was taking pictures in the bright sun- there are light settings but if it is too bright or you are taking a picture with the sun in the back it won't turn out. You get a knack for itBuying film in bulk is absolutely the way to go. The smaller the quantities- the more you pay. That being said, the film for this camera is cheaper than any other I could find. It comes in a bunch of cool colors and you can find accessories like cases, fancy film, photobooks etc to fit too!
Great camera! Simple and easy to use. No instructions needed really. Comes with 2 AA batteries and a wrist strap.
Great camera at a great price! Thanks so much
Am so in love with this camera the color and everything it is the best thing I ever gotten
I thought this was a great camera, ive had it for 3  months+ and still have not had any kind of issues with it. It is fun to use and captures great memories
Purchased this camera for my grand daughter, she loves it!!
This makes making memories special, and it instantly prints which makes it awesome!
Cool camera!
It was a gift for my daughter!!  She loves it and enjoys making her photo collages!!  Great price and shipped quickly!!
Good camera
My favorite accessory to every party!
So cute! Works perfectly fine
Good product would buy again.
My girl loves it!
We used this for a DIY wedding photobooth and it was perfect. So much fun, good pictures too!
just as expacted
Love this product!!!!
Very nice product
It's great for fun!... DOESN'T WORK OUTSIDE.
It's so convinient, it's small and so pretty'', I really liked it! it came in 2 days and is pretty self explanatory, if you're like me you'll read all the reviews before buying it, don't bother I'm telling you right now, it's amazing!
I love this camera. It came quick, packaged well and works great... Easy to use like back in the day Polaroids
I love the product and the way you came in the package was great, it was bubblewraped and it was just perfection! Would definitely buy again!
I got this for my 7 years old girl and she is in love with this camera. She is able to carry it easily anywhere, she can use it without any problem and is fascinated with her pictures. Great gift for any photo lover.
First time user and loved it ! great way to capture the moments
Great for events and vacation mementos.
Cute, Fun to use
Easy to operate and load film, provides great pictures within minutes. It took us some time to figure out lighting but this thing snapped 40 photos in one night and got passed around so everyone could use it. Make sure you're holding it correctly!
It works fine and the 3 pack film was a good deaI really like the camera but I think I would like wider pictures so I'm giving this to my daughter for Christmas. It seems to be really popular with the young people.
The Pictures Will Come Out White And Shifted To The Left
It was amazing.  Didn't know my granddaughters knew how to work the camera.
Awesome little camera. A note for when buying this, you need to remember that you have to buy film and it's almost like each picture you take is one dollar.But you get an instant and cute keepsake.
Isn't working properly or taking quality pictures. Very disappointed
Nothing
It works wonders and is super cute
Awesome camera!! We love it soooo much!
I love this camera
Works Great, fun to use, and batteries last
Fun little point and shoot camera. However, you do have to play around with the lighting as the pictures can easily was out.
I got it for my cousin's birthday! And she LOVED it!
I bought this for my daughter as an 8th grade graduation gift. She loves it!! She takes it everywhere!
Came in the mail on the first day of possible expectancy. Product was just as advertised. Cute and portable, perfect for every moment that a snapchat picture just isn't enough.
Amazing camera get it if you want nostalgic moments of times past.
there is better ones. this one is kinda flimsy
This is a gift for my 7 y/o daughter. The idea of physical photos being printed directly from the camera is completely novel. She loves it. Big hit with the friends too. It's pretty cool to see all of her photography stringed around her bedroom.
I luv it 10/10
We are using this camera as a part of our guestbook, and so far we have taken a few trials before wedding day, and it is just perfect! Easy to learn to use. We will be taking this on our honeymoon too to get some unique vintage snaps!
Love love love this little camera! It's small and easy to fit in a purse or bag. It's also super easy to use and the pictures turn out great! Plus they come in so many great colors, I had a hard time choosing. Love the quality of this product as it's super durable. I've dropped it once already and while it needed a little tweaking, it still works! It also withstood the sun, wind, and sand of a day on the beach.
Every time I take this out with me people love it and have so much fun getting real momentos. The photo cartridges are expensive though
I wasn't aware that Polaroids had made a comeback but apparently they have!  This is what my 17 year old asked for her 11th grade graduation.  She loves it and won't stop snapping pics!  It is very "plasticy" and I'm probably going to order the case for it because I'm afraid if she drops it, it may smash into a hundred pieces.  I'd say just order the film and the case while you're at it!  She's delighted with it!
Simple, light weight, very easy to use. I bring this camera to parties and family gatherings - people love using it! The pictures are quite a bit smaller than that of a Polaroid 600 camera but the images are sharp and they develop much more quickly. Super cute - I would definitely recommend it.
great quality images
This camera is great for the price! Cool function that lets it detect the proper light setting, but not always accurate. Still a great little camera. Recommend this for trips; they create great photos for scrapbooks!
Love this camera one of my best investments
Perfect!
This is just an overall good time. Wanna be the life of the party? Event? Just like instant gratification?? This camera gives it.
I bought this for my wife and she completely loves it and so do I. It's great!
A birthday gift for my 9 year old daughter, she loves it but I noticed mamy of the photos are overexposed.
This is a really fun camera!! The pictures are the perfect size for attaching to my planner, keeping in my wallet, or sticking on the fridge. I like being able to write a caption on the bottom of each picture, too.  The camera itself is easy to use and compact enough to fit in my purse.
This camera is so cute I love the size and the color! I've been using this camera to document my summer and so far it has taken beautiful photos if you're into polaroids. The camera is easy to maneuver and I love how you can change the light settings based on where you are taking the photo. Simple but great camera!
I got the for my daughter for Christmas. She really enjoys being able to print her pictures out. The pictures are good quality. Both the indoor and outdoor pictures come out very well.
Obsessed! It's amazing and the best price I have found!
This is the best!!. Clear photos, great fun. LOVE the PINK!!  Ordered the case and album too. Ready for capturing a funfilled summer!!
I bought this for my sister for her graduation. She absoutely loves it. Its super easy to use and the pictures look fantastic. Its the perfect gift for someone going to college.
Bought it as a present for a friend. She loves it
fun and easy to use nice quality pictures as well
Best gift ever to myself. No problems at all after 6 months of usage. Will buy for gifting purposes.
Great product! Love it and still use it all the time
The Camera doesn't work - The film gets stuck and I can't find a way to return the item OR get a replacement -Need help -
Great instant film camera. Amazon has these at the lowest prices (I shopped around). Overall, the product has performed well - just be sure to have it on the right setting when you are outside or else your pictures will come out too dark!
Gave as a gift.  My daugeter loved it.  great choices of color and this reminded me of years ago when we use to take instant pictures with our camera.  Brought back memories and now my daughter is creating her own.
Love this camera. Super cute and affordable. Taking good pics can be tricky but all you need is a little practice and a lot of films. Took me about 3 packs of film to get the hang of it and get clear pics.
Thanks so much! Cute, tiny, but well worth it!
I had a defective camera from Michaels, returned it and saw this one on amazon for a couple dollars cheaper. This one was not defective and works great! The black is nice however if you have any oil on your face or hands there will be marks on the camera.
cool camera
Loved how the photos came out.
Product looks nice... But camera did not work properly. The camera only took 1 picture out of 10 correctly. The other 9 were not exposed properly.
This was a gift for my grand daughter and she absolutely LOVED IT.  She had so many people asking about it, that she told me she felt so SPECIAL.  Highly recommend it !!!
Love the color!!
I'll change this review if I ever get this camera to work.  The instructions are terrible.  I found an online video explaining how to use it.  The minus battery sits slightly higher than the plus battery (I don't know if this is normal but it would not push down evenly).  The plus and minus signs on the outside of the battery case are opposite of the illustration.  I can't figure out how to attach the wrist strap.  Nothing happens when I push the button to take a picture.  I wasted 1 pack of film in case I had put it in wrong (I had not).  I tried to use new batteries in case the batteries that came with the camera are too old but now I can't get the battery compartment open.  There is no way the camera can fit in to the case.  Like I said, I'll upgrade this review if I get the camera to work.  Otherwise I'll return the camera and the case.
I love this camera so much, great price too
So much fun for parties! Very easy to use. Just have to play with it to figure out the best settings and lighting.
Absolutely love this camera! Works well.
So cute and easy to use. The size makes it easier to transport.
Got it for my daughter for a grad gift.  She loves it!
Good price.  Arrived quickly.  Great little camera.
I had such high hopes for this camera.  I've wasted an entire roll of film already -- the pictures have a smear down one side, so I'm assuming that something is too "tight" where the picture pops out, and that it's streaking the picture.  Also, the pictures are sooooo tiny, and not very crisp, either.  Waste of money.... find yourself the old fashioned polaroid Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera (Yellow)
My children love this camera! Makes them feel like they have a vintage camera
I absolutely love this.  It is just a small polaroid camera from a time ago.  The pictures are small, like 2" by 3" or so.  You set what environment, (such as outside sunny, outside cloudy, inside) on the camera to help ensure a good picture each time.  The only setback I have is the film is not cheap.  The cheapest I could find was a 10 picture pack of film for $12.97.
This camera came in super fast and the color is perfect! I highly recommend this product:)
LOVE IT! works great
Absolutely love it! Super light in weight, adjustable settings for "indoor" "outdoor"...etc. It came with 2 AA batteries and a wrist cord. Fits inside the clear case I bought for it. Pictures come out great!
I love this camera so much! I've wanted one for a long time and it does not disappoint. It's definitely worth the money
I intially purchased this for a music festival but I have used it way more than I thought I would. It's easy to put in a purse or backpack for vacations or day trips. I love the light pink color and how easy it is to work the camera. I like that there are different settings around the camera lense. This makes it easy to get the best picture possible in any environment you are in. I've had no problems with pictures not turning out. Overall I'm very happy with the camera.
I love it when this thing works.  Very hip and the pictures turn out very 70's.  Unfortunately, even when changing the settings appropriately, the lighting is very sensitive and we have been unable to get a decent picture in anything but broad daylight.  Sometimes it's too bright and the picture turns out nearly white, sometimes it's too dark and the picture turns out nearly black.  I still think this camera was worth the investments even with the light difficulties because the pictures that HAVE turned out are splendid and we love them.  They look really great hanging from a string with mini clothes clips.
Got this camera and have hardly used it primarily because the picture quality is very average and the film is ridiculously expensive.  If you're looking for something that takes average photos with muted colors  (not super clear and bright like your phone or digital camera) this is for you.  I think the photos in the ads must have been digitally altered because mine certainly look nothing like those.  This is definitely more of a gimmick than anything else.  Fun to have fairly immediate photos in your hand but it would be nice if they were of a quality that is something to write home about.
It broke within a week
Good
This a very cute and awesome to use and it's very easy to use overall great camera
Came just as expected! I adore this color and look forward to using it :)
Love it. Great Sellers. Item arrived exactly as promised, all the items were in the box (as they were meant to come).  My niece was thrilled! Couldn't have pictured a happier kid. ---Thank you.  5 Stars
I got this for my daughter's 10th birthday and it was a huge hit!  She LOVES it and so do both kids and adults that see it.  Super easy and fun to use!
ABSOLUTLEY LOVE MY NEW INSTANT CAMERA.
I haven't had any problems with it so far. I do need to learn how to use the settings, so far I've made a few mistakes but thats on my side for not reading the instructions. It has been a challenge learning how to take pictures (specialy selfies) with it because of where the button is and how I was used to my phone and compact camera.
Works well. Pictures are mediocre quality. Nice feel of old style Polaroid pictures. Don't shoot anything at a distance as pictures come out white.Had to learn it the hard way 💁 But I blame myself as it does says the distance.
This is a great, fun camera.  I used it for a birthday party and used the 64 page book (sold separately) for the pictures I took.  I gave the filled book to the birthday girl at the end of the party.  She loved it.....  Also, some guests requested to keep their picture because they liked them so much.  Fortunately, I bought enough film to accommodate some requests......  Highly recommend this camera.
Color was more of an orange/red.
Wonderful little camera. The pictures are very small but the quality is great!
Great Product,,,,Small And Fun For Everyone
Was a gift that is continuing to make the recipient happy!
Exactly as the description says!!! Perfect! Couldn't ask for better
Beautiful! Love the vintage look of the pics
Fun for grandkids
Bought this for my daughters 8th birthday cause she's always wanting to use mine. She loves it and we got the matching case as well
This is honestly the cutest best camera ever. So great for parties and what not. I love it and so does everyone else
Cute, awesome camera!
Super cute I use it all the time !
Kid loved it but only evry third photo developed
It's fun, it's cute, one of the better impulse buys you'll make. Let's be real, the photo is pretty damn small but lends itself nicely to portraits. It's a novelty but in the best sort of way. It's a party pleaser. You will have fun. Buy it.
I bought these for my tween-aged granddaughters.  They LOVE them.  I bought extra film and the completing accessories, too, and they were a hit!  Now, these are not going to be high resolution pro pics.  Just the really fun instant photos we enjoyed back in the day.
It received what I was looking for! I needed something to give pictures to the children down in Mexico for a keepsake, so this is great!
It's ok. I'm not very excited at the quality of the pictures that this camera takes. They are drab and sometimes too dark. I don't expect an instant photo to be photographer quality,  but I also didn't expect them to be this poor. I wouldn't buy again.  I wish I bought the full size instant camera.
gift
Simple to use. Photos come out very cute. Camera is relatively inexpensive
There seemed to be nothing wrong with the camera.
Very fun and easy to use!
Love it! And it's so easy to use and convenient!!
fun for little shorties
A cute little camera for on the go.. Takes great wallet size pics! My 16 year old Granddaughter loves it!
The package came great!! But in the description it said there will be batteries included. And there are no batteries.
Love it !!!!! It's so fun!!!!
Great camera, so much fun to use.  Takes great polaroid type pictures.  I love that I can take a picture and have it print instantly.  Easy to use and light weight.  High recommend to take fun photos with friends
awesome​
Easy to use
My daughter loves this camera!
I like it
I am in love with my camera! I use it to keep physical mementos. The size of the photos are as big as a driver's license and that fit right in your wallet. There are lots of DIY's to do with the developed photos as well! The vintage look of the photos is very asthetically pleasing.
The Fujifilm INSTAX Mini 8 automatically focuses for your shot. It captures photos like a point and shoot digital camera. I'm 27 with a 16 month old toddler. I haven't had film developed for about 10 years. With that said being a 90ied kid this is a throwback to those small sticker picture cameras! It's lot of fun to point, click and have a real photo print out! It's very easy to use I didn't even use the directions to figure it out. Anyone who's used any electronics in the past 5 years can use this easy. The Pictures themselves look like my families old photo albums of the 50ies-80ies. They have a beautiful nostalgia to them and are tangible to hold. They also fit perfectly into the drivers license window inside my wallet. I literally ordered over 200 shots of film and like 10 albums. They come out like the old Polaroid floppy photos just smaller! Great buy and affordable price!
very cool camera, but you have to  be carefull with the settings, if its too bright dont forget to turn the light setting to the sun preset,otherwise you'll get blank photos)
I love it! The camera is very self explanatory. The directions are easy and clear. I'm really pleased with how quickly the film processes too. I do wish the film wasn't so expensive but if that's the only downfall there is that's fine with me.
Love this camera!
Good
Was very excited to get this product to complete my husband's 40th white party theme. We had black books out for guests to add photos and notes with a white pen. It was looking amazing until 26 photos in the flash stopped working! We wasted loads more film trying to get it to work, replacing batteries and film. Sadly the flash never worked again so the album came to a halt.
This is a great Polaroid camera. The camera is very attractive and looks great. It is very simple to use with one button to turn it on and one button to take the picture. There is a dial on the lens for different settings such as sunny, cloudy, etc. To close the camera, all you need to do is push the lens down and it closes. I got this as a pack with this, the film, and the carrying case. All three were a great purchase and this product is absolutely something that I will continue to use down the line. The only con is that the camera is quite bulky. However, this is to be expected from a Polaroid Camera.Pro:Attractive, easy to useCons:Quite Bulky
kids love it
Love the color
I LOVE this camera! It's so awesome how the pictures come out right as you take them and you get to watch them develop. The picture quality is as good as printing out pictures from your iPhone. Quick and fun experience.
I love this camera! it is super light and the bow does come with instructions on how to get ready. the camera does not come with film so make sure you buy some when you buy it. super fast delivery i got it two days after I order it.helpful link: [...]
lightweight and easy to use!
I bought this as a gift for my niece birthday and she loves it! The only bad is that the films are expensives. Really good camera
when you buy this, be realistic in expectations, its for fun. I got this as a fun little gift for a friend and she loves it but quality is terrible and the exposure levels and everything about it isn't high-quality, do expect to get shots that are just whited out because of lighting and the exposure. I've had better luck for instants on older polaroid's but this is a fun toy, it does cost a lot in the end do to the instant film.
Love it!! Works great!!
Cute little camera! Works great
My girlfriend loved it! a bit of a learners curve
Bought for my baby sister (16 y.o) and she LOVES it. Apparently these are the new fad so it worked great for her.
The camera is really cool looking & easy to use. The film is very expensive. I've tried many different methods of using the camera but I still find the actual photos it takes are hit or miss. Some look good, most are too bright because the flash goes off no matter what. I've tried to cover the flash, but it's a shot in the dark (pun!) whether your pic will come out good. Even my good photos are not that great, and the price of the film makes me want more from my shots.Someone told me it's just a "selfie camera" and I shouldn't expect much from a polaroid camera. Maybe that's it but I've used older polaroid cameras & found their photos were much more charming. I wanted a tangible alternative to cell phone pics, which I never look at after I've taken them, but this isn't it for me. That being said, if you want small pics for fun this is a pretty cool camera.
My daughter absolutely loves the camera! Bought it for her graduation party so guests could take pictures. She wouldn't give the camera up Lol
My daughter loves this. Very easy to use. It is a lot of fun for kids.  Take it out of the box put the film in and you are ready to go,
My daughter loves it.
Great camera but pictures are not so clear!
Nice product
Good enough for kids trying to have fun with instant pics - quality of pics is ok.
Great
This camera will not print out properly if you are too much in the sun.
Well made camera. Should last as long as you want to buy the expensive film!
Love this camera! It's so adorable and a wow feature where ever I go. My only issue is now everyone wants a picture and film is crazy expensive! So NO you can't have a captured moment that I want to keep because I'll never see it again! Be prepared for the "omg that's so cute! Let me keep this one!(yea not a question more of a demand lol)"Great flash a couple times I forgot to turn the dial to the right setting so it made the picture a bit dark but still beautiful. Seriously though this camera brings me back to my Polaroid days and now my kids are taking it to school so they can snap pictures of everyone...and coming home with 2 pictures.
I really enjoy using this camera! The only problem I've noticed is that it doesn't take super great pictures in bright lighting. Other than that, it has been perfect! I love the way the photos turn out, the quality of the picture, and how easy it is to use.
I love the product itself! However I was disappointed to find that there was no film included. Besides that, love it!
Exelente
I really enjoy this camera -- if you've never seen them, the pictures ARE quite small, but you can capture a huge area.
I like
Works great! Only problem is that you have to remember to set (despite the glowing indicator light) the setting dial on whatever works best (for example, if you are taking a picture outside but it suggests the indoor setting, you have to turn the dial to indicate that you would like the outdoor setting instead if you want the photo to develop correctly) Awesome product!
It's really nice! Film is super expensive, but if you buy it in bulk it isn't as bad. Also figuring out the lighting for everything is a little difficult, everything seems a little bit too under or over exposed. Though with that, put it on the setting the camera tells you to. Also get a case if you can afford it, it makes carrying around the camera so much easier.
pictures are a little small but my daughter really loves this and has had a lot of fun with the camera so far
It's such a pretty camera! I love the little Pictures.
I can't say enough about this camera. My granddaughter can't stop taking pictures. It's the cutest thing ever. I was the coolest grandmother on her birthday.
Lov
Oh I love it so much it's doing so good I had another one but it's actually broke. No one's fault but my own I love this camera and I would recommend it to just about anyone. However keep in mind it is a toy camera so in a way and should be regarded as such although performance is totally top notch for the price.
Like the idea, but it's difficult to get the right settings in order to take a good picture.  The lighting setting isn't always the right setting for the shot.  Sometimes you just get lucky.
So fun in Mexico...we laughed at all the mischief we were exposed...very cute...we are now giving them to out grandchildren
I got this camera back in January (currently June) I was very excited about it. when I received it, it did not include film which I was very disappointed about. u have spend $10 to buy film sepratly. I ended up not using it and selling it at a garage sale. but overall it looked beautiful and included a strap.
I'm happy I got this but at the same time I am really disappointed. It doesn't come with any film not even a sample pack. Due to this I'm not able to test is out or write a better informative review.
Very nice!!!
Perfect!
Excellent camera. I would highly recommend it.
Oh my gosh! I can not even say enough about this product! I am in love with it. I bought it for my wife's birthday, because she has been wanting a Polaroid camera for a long time now. I did a lot of research on it and found out that the majority of the consumers liked it, so i decided to get it for her. I am SO glad that I did buy this for her. We absolutely love it! On the way out from dinner, we popped in a film pack to take our first picture, and the picture turned out so amazing!!! We have used it so many other times in just a short period of time. The pictures are amazing! they give you that old rustic feel to them, but they just printed. It's really amazing to me to see how the pictures develop! Words can not describe the awesomeness of this camera! I love it and want to take pictures with it all the time, even though I originally bought it for my wife!
great product
My girls are having a ball with this camera.  Now I am spending all day picking up pictures around the house and in the car!!!
My daughter loves it but, of course, just like I told her, the film costs a fortune and this would end up being a novelty item. However, she wanted it so bad for so long it was worth it just to see the look on her face.
Great product and fun. Film does cost a lot but it ones with the territory. If I could do this over again I'd purchase the wider version. Still a great piece and a lot of fun for the moment
I bought this camera so I could take a quick, small picture at the pottery studio to record pieces in progress. I didn't need anything fancy.  The pictures produced by this camera were of such low quality it was essentially useless. Additionally, the pics were consistently off-center, cutting off much of the piece.Perhaps the camera would do better outside, or farther from the subject. It didn't do what I needed, so I'm returning it.
obsessed
I love my Polaroid!
This is such a fun instant film camera.  It is not very heavy and so easy to use.  Of course, the viewer is a bit small especially if you are used to cameras with a digital background view. I had to get used to looking through such a small peephole. The picture itself develops much quicker than the old Polaroids.  The downside is the size of the picture - it's why it's called "mini" for a reason.  This is still a lot of fun for the young and the old alike. I would highly suggest purchasing online.  Best Buy is $20 more in the store.  Also, the film is $20 in store, whereas you can purchase a pack of three for a better deal (on line). Great gift for young kids, teens or an adult with a youthful soul.  I'm almost 50 and I love it.  The pictures are vibrant in color.  The directions arrive in several different languages including English.  It will discuss how to adjust for brightness among other selections.
Cute camera, love the concept, but the film is a little pricey. Also hard to get good photos indoors. I find that I rarely use it.
thanks
Deberia haber traido fotos incluidas.
I purchased this camera in June and it completely stopped working after 3 months and a total of 10 pictures. Wish I could return it but now I'm stuck with a camera that I paid $75 that does now work :(
My granddaughter really wanted this camera.  I bought with the extra accessories and she loved it.
My daughter loves this thing. Haven't had any of the technical issues I read about so far. It's been 7 months and she uses it often.
Color is a little odd. More coral like then raspberry.  But it shipped quickly and my daughter likes it.
It worked great for the first pack of film, them jammed and we haven't been able to use it since.
My 14 year old LOVES this camera. Disclaimer: not selfie friendly. Since she's figured out the settings, she has been taking some fun pictures! My only gripe is the that the film is so pricey!
Works great, daughter took it to college. loves it
Fun and functional (with the instant gratification factor) camera for all ages.
Great product for an instant camera. Obvious draw-back is that you get one shot at your picture. No redos
I have always wanted one of these cameras! I love that Amazon has a wide variety of color selections for the cameras. It's easy to use. My son loves to take pictures on it!!
Arrived on time and works wonderfully. Everything I expected.
fun photos are back in style
Not the best quality camera.
really nice! came really fast and works really well!!
Great little camera for my girlfriend. She requested a camera for her scrap booking. I found this online and though it would be great. She loves it, the photos are great and are perfect for scrape booking.
Purchased this camera as a gift for my daughter. She loves it!
Cute camera but the color of the photos isn't great
I looooove this camera!
I thought I purchased this camera for myself but my toddler daughters have taken it completely over! Will purchase another one for my grandma soon!
Amazing camera!!! It's so fun to take physical pictures. Make sure to buy film also.
Bought for my daughter for her 13th birthday. Takes great quality little pictures with instant gratification of the instant print. The camera is sturdy and durable for older kids. It sure made my teen happy!
Terrific. Item as described. Works great and my teenage daughter loves it. A lot of fun.
got here on time and it was just as expected.
i love the quality and its just what i expected
Great throwback item for Polaroid pictures!
Thank you for your quick processing and shipping. The product was arrived just as described and works like a dream!
love love love
It is a fun way to take pictures in an age where everything is digital. The prints are a bit smaller than I thought, but they come out really great! Only other issue is that the Instax cartridges are a bit more expensive than I'd like too. Still like it though and it great to hang these up on the fridge or other DIY frames for theses.
This is exactly the camera my daughter wanted & she loves it! Fast shipping & no hassles.
Great
Great fun little camera. Fun for all ages this camera instantly prints out Polaroid style photos.
great item fast shipping
This camera is perfect for beginners. I was very pleased with how this product works and how fast it came to my house. I have so much fun with it, though I would recommend keeping multipule rolls of film on hand at a time because once you get inspired, it's hard to stop.
So darn cuttee!!! Love it!btw I got the strap in a bundle.
Didnt come with an actual instruction manual so half of my photos are messed up. Good luck.
In love!! I take it every where with me and it's so simple but adds the cutest touch to taking a picture
Love, love, love! I purchased this for my 14 year old daughter and the whole family has enjoyed using it. Pictures turn out much better than the old Polaroids. Great product!
Great camera! I had trouble adjusting it to take pictures outside. Indoors the pictures are great.
We love this little camera! We use it to take photos of all the important moments in our lives!
The throwback feel to this camera made it fun to use.
Came in excellent shape and in the box, brand new and works excellent!
I love the camara!!!!! It have a very good quality !!!!
I recommend this camera to anyone who simply adores the nostalgic feel of having a camera that doesn't have to be plugged into a computer to access photos, but to have a physical copy of the memory they had just made. I myself have always been fascinated by the idea of a Polaroid and simply love this cute camera that has been remodeled to a smaller and compact form to perfection. Just the one thing that I would like to warn anyone who gets this... FILM IS NOT CHEAP.
I bought this as my daughters 8th grade graduation gift and she Loves it<3
These are great cameras. This is the second one we have purchased.
Bought this camera for my son, and he loves to play with it. But on a trip to the beach found out the camera can't take a picture without looking exposed. Tried to adjust the lense setting but the camera just couldnt compensate for the light. It's fine for pictures inside but not outside.
This camera is so fun! We take it on our adventures and take fun photos. I love the Polaroid look and this camera definitely gives that. My only complaint is the photos are so small. I wish they'd make one with regular sized Polaroids.
Cute, easy to find film and accessories for. This bundle is a great deal, as well.
My daughter loves this!  Just wish film came with it to start off with.
This camera is so fun. My daughter got it for her 8th birthday and is taking pictures left and right. It doesn't contain a lot of film within each packet so my suggestion would be to purchase a bundle of film and ensure the person using is taking purposeful pictures.
This is a great little camera
This camera is absolutely so cute and amazing and fun to use. It has great battery life and comes in a variety of different colors. Me and my friend both have one and neither of us has had a problem with them. But the film can get pricey so use it sparingly and only to capture memories!Best camera you can buy for only 54 dollars! Really great price for a really great product! Buy it and have fun!!
Brings back old memories and now I get to make some pretty cool ones with my 4 year old, he is obssesed with the pictures coming out right away, they look great, it does take some practice using the light settings but it's worth the money and haven't had any blank film so far
My daughter really wanted this for her 13th birthday after she did a bunch of research. She loves it!
My 3 year old loves her camera and knows how to work it!
Great product, great quality. Very happy I purchased!
Purchased for my grand daughter as an introduction to photography. I did try it out, though, and am very pleased with the ease of operation as well as the quality of photos produced. A very good purchase, especially for the price (under $60.)
A well received high school graduation gift!!
We gave this Instax Mini as a gift and had it shipped directly to the birthday girl.  She just gave it back to us, saying it doesn't work, and the "window of return policy" is closed!  We are out $55 plus shipping!!!!
It was a birthday present for my daughter and she love it and as a matter of fact am placing a another order cause one like her friends like it so much am getting it for her
LOVE IT! LOVE IT LOVE IT, only trick thing was the setting on the flash but the directions explain everything! Wasted all my film in one day i loved the way the pictures came out!
I'M IN LOVE, THANK YOU SO MUCH 
What an amazing little camera! I have been wanting to purchase this for a while and I'm so glad I finally did. It's small but not so tiny that it's easy to drop and it's so simple to use. I'm still getting used to the picture settings on it (cloudy/sunny/indoor/outside) but all in all I am so impressed!Only flip side is that you have to buy the film separately but it's a small price to pay for such a great little camera :)
Bought for daughter'so birthday. She asked for one months ago. I hope she likes it 😉
The camera takes amazing pictures. The focus is well. The Polaroid even has settings for the type of area you are in. The settings are Home/Inside, Cloudy/Outside/Dark, Sunny/Outside/Light, Very Sunny/Outside/Bright, Hi-Key. Each setting really makes the pictures look better depending on the meeting you use and the climate of which you are in.
Super fast shipping to Turkey. Love it!
So Cute!!
Looking at the reviews this looked like a great, fun camera.  The pics are so grainey cant hardly tell what the picture is.
I definitely love using this camera! Easy to use! Not bulky! Adjustable flash settings are convenient!
Wife loves it
Yay!  Polaroids are back!  I got this for my nine-year-old who has gone crazy with it (don't' forget to buy extra film packs) and takes it everywhere.  Very easy to operate and has user friendly option to change the exposure which wasn't an option on the 70's cameras that i remember.  Rugged and durable with big buttons and controls.  Flash is nice and bright and takes lovely pictures inside as well as outside.  This will last a long long time.
I love it! Just as described, takes awesome pictures very self explanatory. :)
I bought this for my granddaughter.  The first one did not take very clear pictures. I reorder and this one works  very well.. We are very happy with it.
awesome camera great little pictures!!!!
I bought this for my niece and she loved it. The only problem I have with it is it that's not come with film. Now I have to order some.
It was a hit for our wedding guestbook idea!
My second time buying one of these as a gift. They are great! No issues
I love it ! It's great
For those of you who are looking to purchase a more affordable Polaroid camera; one that is easy to use and that quickly prints off credit card sized memories, look no further! This is a great way to strengthen bonds in the prevailing digital age. There's something very candid about a photo snapped that cannot be altered or shopped after being printed. Perhaps the only drawback (if any) is that the film itself is rather expensive. However, buying in bulk, using Amazon of course ;), makes for a reasonable price. I would highly recommend this camera! I would also recommend buying a case to avoid any unnecessary exposure to the film once stored inside, although I've personally had no issues with this so far. Enjoy!
Great Camera
My daughter loves it, not too bad, but don't expect good quality photos from it either... just a polaroid toy, if you will.
When I first saw this camera I thought it was good. I still think that it's good but I want the mini 90. Has more features for my taste. This camara really is for kids and with basic functions.
We love it and it arrived in PERFECT condition!  :)
Second camera I bought (this one was a gift). Light. Easy to use. Good side pictures. Obviously doesn't compare to a "real" camera (not phone although that sometimes comes very close) in terms of resolution but nice to be able to give out photos on the spot and it's something different.
I'm in love with this camera! It's compact and very easy to use. Doesn't come with the film but you can get a bundle (camera + twin pack film). My new favorite toy!
Gave it to my mom as a mothers day gift and she loved it!
Super fun camera for parties and get together's!  I wouldn't bother taking it on a trip or anything but it's a fun way to capture and share instantly.  The teens love pinning them to the roof of their cars or on their walls.  We used this at my sons graduation party and it was wonderfully successful!
makes me think of the older days of picture taking.. instant gratification!
This is fun to print some instant pictures but it doesn't work in sunshine! We were at the beach and even early morning or late evening it didn't develop, Disappointing.
I love this, it came fast in a good sized box, and it was cheaper than the one in store at best buy! It takes really cute pictures, and it's very easy to use.
bought this for something fun to do at my son's high school graduation party. It was such a huge hit that the next few parties we've hosted, this has been a request and now my 4 adult children are fighting over it! The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is the pictures sometimes come out over exposed and the film can is quite pricey.
This is a great camera and is so cute!! Yes this listing is 100% authentic. Love this so much it is such a great way to record memories, and even looks cute just sitting in a desk or shelf. Live it!
Daughter loves it, works good, easy to load and useDownside is no adjustable zoom, film goes quick, and you have to make sure of your flash setting for a clear picture
SO SO SO CUTE, I LOVE IT. If you dont get this right now, you are missing out. It came right on time, fast shipping, no damage. Recommend it 100%
Exactly what I expected per photo and description.  Works great.  Super cute.
This item broke within one month of owning it. I handled it with care and did not damage it in any way, but after using it only a few times it completely stopped working. I am unable to return it so I am stuck with a useless camera. Complete waste of my money.
i love this camera soo much, if you buy this then watch youtube tutorials on this and you will be good to go!the color is the same as in the picture.comes with batteries and and string thing so u can put it on your hand with out having to hold the camerareally easy to use.it tells you how many pictures (film) you have left.hope this helped :)
Pictures come out good, no problems.
Takes great pictures...clear and sharp. My grand daughter was delighted when she opened this on her birthday!
My niece loves it!
The pictures from this camera are so cute and tumblr! Totally recommend it''
Everything about this order was perfect.
My 11-year-old daughter bought this herself with money she had saved... She absolutely loves it! Easy to use and the pictures come out great. All her friends want one now! Very happy with this camera!
An inexpensive camera that makes quick humble memories. The film ends up being more expensive that the camera itself over time.
This little camera is awesome!! I love the size of the pictures and its so easy to operate!lets just say this...I bought this for my 7yr old daughter's birthday and she uses it like a pro!I want one now!!
Everything came undamaged and new and my friend absolutely freaked and loved this camera. 10/10!!!
Very cute! Easy to work for someone with minimal camera experience, equally as workable for someone with lots of camera experience. Exact size I was expecting. Love the color! More of an off white than stark white which is great. Two charm holders on each side of the camera and wide blank space on the back to put lots of stickers!
Make sure you have the proper environment setting on because otherwise you waste a lot of film. We were outdoors and didn't change the setting so several pictures were over exposed. We used 2 of these cameras for my 8 year old's birthday scavenger hunt.
easy to use great
Feel like it's more like a reddish orange color not raspberry. Idk if that's the point but was expecting more like a dark pinkish color. Other than that great cam!!
Easy to use. Exactly as described.
brings back memories of my polaroid days! my daughter received this at Christmas with two packs of film. Works well, just don't push the button until you're ready, I mistakenly took a few pictures of the ceiling and my face trying to figure it out... there goes that film! Film cartridges are not large, usually about 10 in each pack, and if you or your kids are having fun with a group you'll go through them fast probably. Still they are fun, pictures are much smaller than traditional polaroids, but just about as clear and focused as original.
it is so fun to use and it works perfectly.
I love it! It is amazing. Totally worth the money!  Easy to use. Works amazingly. The only slight downside is dirt sticks to it pretty easily. But if cleans off easily too. Totally recommend this!
I'm giving this product one star, this product was defective, never turned on when I received it, changed batteries multiple times hopefully factory warranty will let me replace it and I can rate this product accordingly
my grandaughter loves it
Love this camera I have so much fun with it!
I bought this as a gift for my daughters graduation. She loves it, She took so many pictures with it of her friends before and after graduation.
I bought these for my daughter's (7) and (11).  They love them.  I recommend purchashing a case or the kit that includes a case.  It full of cute, helpful accessories.  My only complaint is using the camera on Sunny days makes the photo washed out looking. Indoor photos or if your in the shade look great.  I highly recommend the Mini 8 and the accessories!
My wife loves this!  I gave it to her as a birthday gift and she thought it was so fun and delightful.  Funny how having concrete polaroid shots are now unique again.  She loved the pink color.  It's easy to operate.  I thought it was terrific.  Well balanced in terms of being well-made, fun looking and a good price.
My 4 year old loves her camera. Great for practice and teaching perspective and control. Easy to use and with good grasp for a child.
Great fun camera.
The camera works as expected. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because I expected it to be smaller than the cameras that print standard sized Polaroids.  We, obviously, found that not to be the case. This camera is as equally bulky as the standard instant-print cameras.
Quick delivery and great value price point. The same camera at the store pricing i found was slightly higher and it's also so convenient to order it online
Yee
So much fun. This little camera takes nice instant photos.
The pictures turned out awesome !
Love this camera!  I've shot around 150 photos with it so far and only a couple times it was under or over exposed, but that was probably just because of the setting I had it on.  Sometimes I get someone to shoot my photo, then in turn I'll offer to shoot one for them and give them the photo.  Everyone pretty much loves it too!  No regrets!
lovely color, I love it.
I bought it for a birthday girl, and it was defected. The camera filters did not work besides the default one, and all the pictures came out really dark (I guess the defaulted one was defected as well). Which wasted all the films and the memorable moments. I am very disappointed. I don't understand how come a new product can this much be defected. I requested for exchange hoping that the next one won't be totally defected. If it is, I will update the review and warn all of you not to get this product.I and the birthday girl were both excited about the gift, so we feel really bad about this. I am a loyal Amazon customer over several years, I almost never get defected products. I am very surprised too.
Lots of fun
Great product, fast service!! Thank you!
Amazing and I love this camera!Takes some practice to use but once you figure it out it's so worth it!
This Polaroid camera is awesome! It is easy to use and is pretty compact so it is not hard to carry around when you go out. They also have a strap that saved me from dropping it a couple times!
I am delighted with this camera. It's super cute and lovely
Bad, broken in one week
Does not take pictures outdoors!
Really love this item!
All good
Great size and the photos are perfect for my wedding photo booth
So fun. the photos are not as big as the old time polaroid but still worth it.
The camera is awesome. I got this as a present for my girlfriend and she definitely "showed" her appreciation for it.
I love this camara I don't use it enogh!
The most impractical camera ever, just bought it because my wife asked for it as a mother's day gift.  In a time when it's so cheap to buy a nice digital camera that you can use to shoot 200 pics, then choose the 20 best and edit them befor printing them, is dumb to have this camera that offers no options.  Well I guess there are a lot of not very bright people that don't mind to waste $50.00.
A great camera!!! Takes good pictures, easy to read manual, and is just great over all. It's not too big and it's not small. Only bad thing is that it didn't come with film, and film (not bought on Amazon) is pretty expensive. And the color isn't as vibrant as they picture it. But color does want matter. This product works amazingly. Would recommend.
Worth every single penny who ever your buying this for, for you or a friend , you will fall in love with it !
Perfect! I bought this for my vacation and it was exactly what I wanted and more! I definitely recommend buying on here, it's way cheaper on Amazon rather than in stores like Walmart. I also recommend buying film on Amazon, there's some great deals!
This camera is adorable and works great. I love it as a more affordable option to polaroid brand cameras. I've been using it for over six months with no problem! Highly recommend.
I got the yellow camera and it is sooo pretty! It's lightweight, adorable and has multiple setting to change the lighting!! This is awesome! Thanks Fujifilm!
Great price, amazing quality, Great buy I don't regret buying this camera in fact I wish I would have brough it sooner.
This camera is amazing, it came really fast…I dropped it the first day I got it and lens protector popped out I was scared because I broke it the first day but I just popped the lens protector back where it was and it is holding up
Wonderful
It worked perfectly
Im loving this polaroid, the pictures come out in hd and good focus, came earlier than expected. Its a great girft for someone who loves taking pictures
Awesome little camera! Color is beautiful.definitely recommend it!
film got caught the very first time it was inserted.  the camera has been inoperable.. suggest going with a different brand if you are purchasing for a young adult
Polaroid type film. What a super fun come-back!!! I’ve only taken a few pictures but I am very pleased with the outcome. Outside photos are better then inside (so far anyway). Haven’t experimented with all the settings yet.Just remember they will not be what you may print from a Nikon, etc.,  or your iPhone,  but the whole idea is just great fun!I ordered (and received) the raspberry color but it’s more of a coral. Still pretty though.I would recommend purchasing.Enjoy!!
Do not buy !!!!  Worked great for 2 months (was Christmas gift for granddaughter) after 2 months REGARDLESS of settings pictures would be over exposed (dark) or underexposed ( white).  I tried to return and neither amazon or company who the product came from. Would accept return after January 31st. Only 1 month returns are allowed and for the price of $70.00. I feel I should get refund or replacement!!
My girlfriend loved it!! Great pictures with a hipseterish vibe
The color is exactly the same from the photo. I'm so exited to try it!. Its cute and comes with an adorable strap. Was debating on this and the 8+ but just seem like the selfie mirror attached wasn't worth the extra 50 so i got this instead.
I gave this to my mother in law for her Bday and she loved it!! She told me today that she brought it to work and all the ladies there are going to order one now. Lol. It's SO fun. I have one myself and that's why I purchased one for her. She seen mine and seemed to like it. So yeah, she cried when  she got it and it works just fine!!
I LOVE MY CAMERA ITS SO CUTE AND IT WAS SO CHEAP!!
I'm sure the camera will be ok, but am dinging the makers of it for not including at least one small package of film with it.  Now I've got to order that and wait a couple more days.
I received my camera today and to be honest I'm a bit disappointed. The camera is cute looking but it's not functioning right. I went to walmart to purchase some film to test the camera. Took 5 photos and they all came out dark/black. Does anyone know what could be wrong with it? Thanks
Arrived on time in perfect condition. Love love love this camera, doesn't work well outdoors but works perfect in doors. Would definitely recommend.
My nine-year-old daughter received this for her birthday and she absolutely loves it.
Love this little camera! It doesn't take the quality pictures I was hoping for, but it's still cute.
Step-daughter loves it! Directions are a tad confusing and I liked the previous generation better. This one has too many bells and whistles, and isn't your simple point and shoot instant camera.
I think the product is very cool. I bought it for my 3 year old's birthday party. We had a photo wall with dress up items. The kids' minds were collectively blown when the picture came out of the camera. They would fight over who got to take it out :)ANYWAY, the product itself feels kind of cheap and it's strange that the way to turn it off is to just push the lens in with your hand, but so far no problems so maybe it doesnt matter that it feels cheap.I've only taken about 20 pictures with it, but so far, so good.
I love my camera. It's very cute and takes nice photos. It definitely was a good purchase.
I always wanted a polaroid camera and was excited when I got this. However I did have some buyers remorse. First, when you take the picture it doesn't come out as it looks through the lens. The object will be either really far or close and fuzzy. Its hard to adjust the light setting because sometimes pictures in the shade come out really dark. Second. You can only take 10 pictures before you need a new roll. And the film is expensive. Its about a dollar per sheet and if you mess the picture up. You just wasted money. I really like it to take general pictures but no advanced photography. I ended up purchasing the Fujimax printer which I liked so much better because I could print out pictures from my phone that I really liked. You know what the picture looks like before you print it, and you could always edit the picture before printing it. I do like the camera but you are better off buying the printer than the camera.
THINK BEFORE YOU BUY!! The reason that I bought this camera is because my friend has one and as a college student I think it’s really cool and to have one by my own. LOL!!! However, the fact is that I only used it two times and NEVER use it again. I was really exciting when I just received the camera. Be honestly, FujiFilm Instax Mini 8 is a cute-costly-camera. It’s can give you the photo in 10 seconds and it has many different models, like indoor and outdoor. It is a great camera to help you keep the moment and share the photos with your friends. The camera seems cheap which only $78.87; however, for me, the films are SUPER expensive, like 20 sheets for $12.48.  The most important is that if you don’t keep the film in a safe place (it can’t be exposed under sun, you can’t put any pressure on the films, and it can’t be taken out once you put it into the camera.), it will waste the whole package of films. WARNNING!!! If you don’t use the camera, you better take the batteries out. Even though you don’t use the camera, the batteries will still die out really quick. If you really want to have one, you better ask yourself---DO I REALLY NEED IT? If you have many many great moments then you should. Nevertheless, if you like me, don’t have much parties then I suggest you do not waste your money and take photos by your phone.
ok
Soooo cute!
This camera is fantastic. Pictures are beautiful. Fun addition for our scrapbook.
I have not used it for the event that I bought the camera for.  But the 'test drive' was great!  Took great pictures.
I bought this for my stepdaughter's `14th birthday.  She loves it.  Obviously, if you are looking for a super high quality photo, this would not be the camera.  What it is perfect for is taking and printing shots instantly.  They are small little pictures that you can put anywhere.  They fit perfectly in planners, SMASH books, scrapbooks, or other little projects such as that.  The film isn't super cheap so you need to be willing to take a less than perfect, spontaneous shot as you won't want to take a dozen to get the "perfect" shot.  Overall, this camera is perfect for teens and adults to just take fun photos!
I love it!!!
so far its great!
My daughter loves it. Great pictures
Good
Basics: This camera arrived really quickly. The grape colour is exactly as it appears on the site. It came with batteries and an instruction manual with English on it.I wanted a  instant camera for a long while and so I took the plunge when I saw it was a good deal. I chose the grape because I loved the colour and it arrived shortly after. The first picture I took was clear but somewhat lower quality than the reviews led me to believe thus the removal of one star. Still, it was a great picture and the camera is adorable and sturdy. I will definitely love exploring this cute little tool.
Love it
Absolutely LOVE IT
Pictures are darker than the old school Polaroid.  It's ok Probably would not buy again.
This is a beautiful, probably not practical, Hello Kitty Instant Cam. So if you are the kind like me who is in love with Hello Kitty enough to completely disregard impracticability this is for you. I don't see myself carrying it around all the time since it is huge and only loads 10 mini pics at a time, but I will pull it out for instant gratification.
Cute lil camera, bought this for an 11 year old. She loves it, has little pictures of her and her friends and family all over her room. I just purchased  more film for this the other day.
Love this camera it's so cute and everyone loves it
I was so excited to get this. I was not dispointed. It's a cute size easy to use and just fun.
Great product.
Fun toy
Who doesn't love a Polaroid?
Great little camera; daughter enjoys it.
Great gift for kids.
Great product, but good thing I purchased films.. didnt know there were no films
Absolutely wonderful buy!
In love with this product! My husband ordered it for a Christmas gift and I have had so much fun with it.
I love this so much! It takes amazing photos!
Best camera ever
My daughter loved the camera!
Bought this for my 13 year old daughter.  She loves having a photo instantly and I appretiate the nostalgia.
my daughter loves this camera
Very small pics!!
When I purchased this camera is was broken. I didn't even get to use it once, very disappointed.
Bought these for our daughters for Christmas and they love them.
LOVE this camera. It came packaged nicely and promptly. I definitely recommend getting this. Cheaper than a Polaroid, but does the same job.
Purchased this item for my daughters graduation for guests to take a picture with her. It was not what I expected and the pictures that did turn out were poor quality. I would NOT recommend this item to anyone. Not sure if it was the camera or the film but out of 20 taken maybe 5 were decent. Memories were lost and I am very disappointed with this item.
Great quality camera and very user friendly! Love how the pictures have that nostalgic look to them. Would recommend.
I love this camera I take with me everywhere. Its great for little photos. The only thing I didn't realize is the size of the film is very small. I wish It was bigger but other than that, It's great!
The camera is amazing (I got the twin pack so it came with the film) but it came earlier than expected which was super thrilling. It came undamaged which was a big relief and the film wasn't damaged either. I followed the instructions word for word (it's not that hard to follow) and took my first picture. It developed just fine and came out great. I started taking more pictures and it was so much fun they all came out perfect. I highly recommend getting this product I can't wait to buy more film for the camera.
Bought this for a gift, my daughter loved it! Works good.
My husband bought this camera for me as a Christmas gift.  Sorry I waited past Christmas for delivery because it just wasn't worth it.  The camera did not feel good in my hands and I felt as though I was going to drop it.  The quality of the pictures was very poor.  You couldn't even tell what you were looking at.  I sent the camera back for a refund.
very nice, there was one little scratch but overall, I loved it!
Excellent product!
I'm writing this as my 9yr daughter tells me what she does and doesn't like about. She loves this because it is purple, it is a good fit for hwr hands and isn't too big and being able to get immediate pictures when she meetsa new friend.  The only think she doesn't like or at least doesnt seem to matter is the focusing feature.  She says she can't tell any difference.I actually used it at a family reunion and it was so great because you can immediately get pictures of folks you may not see again and share them.  Many older folks may not be inclined to know how to get online to download digital pictures that are emailed.  This is a great alternative.  I have tons of pics in my phone but I have 8 on of these Instax on my fridge that I see everyday.
I absolutely love my camera. It is so cute and small so you can bring it everywhere. It also takes adorable pictures.
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she has used it a lot since.  It takes poor quality pictures, even given the novelty of what it is.  The flash is always on, making for some additional difficulty in taking decent pictures.  If you're expecting old school Polaroid sized pictures, you'll be sorely disappointed.  The pictures are roughly half that size.  Add to that the considerable expense of the film and a lot of the fun of this camera quickly fades.  Do yourself a favor, try out the Polaroid instead.
The pictures are tiny. The viewfinder is nearly impossible to see through. All you can do is point in the general direction and hope.
Muy buen producto
This was bought for a friend & she loved it!
AWFUL. DOES NOT WORK AND A WASTE OF MONEY.
2nd time buying and still a great experience! This was a gift for my brother and he loved it
Great price and a very cool product!
OK - this thing is awesome!It is a crowd pleaser, it is fun and easy. My 9 year old LOVES it. We got some props and did a photobooth with it, and she loves taking the pictures and watching them magically appear.  You can then use the results for photo magnets, and buttons and bookmarks and just anything fun!The only drawback - this is a mostly indoor camera - the outdoor shots we've taken are very very exposed.
love it
I have always wanted a polaroid and was ecstatic when I saw this one for a great deal. Easy to load film and love the wrist strap it comes with. Definitely need some practice with using it in proper lighting situations, but it is a fun little camera to have for quick little memories to make.
LOVE LOVE LOVE MY CAMERA!!!!!!!
I did not like the quality of the picture its very dark , if you post videos on how to take clear picture that might be helpful
Luv it
Purchased a couple of these cuties for my wedding and honestly, best investment ever!!! Easy to  use and great quality photos.Best part was that the both times i purchased items arrived sooner than expected! 100% recommended.
I gave this camera to my 6 year old daughter for her birthday and she absolutely loves it! She couldn't wait to start taking pics. The picture quality is great. There were a few times it might have been over exposed but we just need to figure out the lighting. I would recommend this item.
8th Bday gift for my daughter- was a total hit!  we bought a cool board to put up in her room to put the pics!
Good camera. Got a 20 dollars gift card from seller.
It works great
I ordered pink, the box was pink but when I opened it the camera was blue.
Love the color! It's easy to use, and it's super cute!
Love this camera and the cute colors! So fun to use!
Love this camera! Our kids love it too. Brings me back to my dad's old Polaroid camera but with a much updated look.It's a snap and shoot kind of camera. I'm still getting used to how to set the flash to the correct setting since we've had a few pictures come out kind of dark but it's been so fun. The actual pictures are smaller than what we had back in the day and you have to purchase those separately. Quality of the picture actually surpassed my expectations. When I have the settings set correctly the picture comes out really nice.We wanted something that would produce pictures instantly, reasonably priced and something our kids could use. We found it with this fun camera.
Great little camera. Sadly, exactly half of the prints didn't process. At $1/print, this is a costly defect.
daughter loves it
It wasn't very accurate with the amount of film left
These pictures are tiny!  I remember the old Polaroid camera and they were decent sized photos.  The camera is fun, you get photos right away, but they are probably only 2" X 1", something like that.  I didn't measure, but they are small compared to old size.
I love this camera! A few days after I purchased it, a few of my friends purchased one of their own. The only thing that is iffy is the somewhat-frequent underexposure/overexposure in photos taken with the correct adjustments per the actual setting (with sunlight, in the dark, etc.).
Excelente
Doesn't seem to change setting, but once you get used to it, it takes cool pictures!  Really digging it.
This is a great little instant picture camera me and my friends love using this! My only complaint is that you can't control the flash but other then that it is very fun.
She absolutely loves it
I love this camera!!
Love it
It's great - easy to work and vintage- love it
Awesome!
I bought this camera for my daughter for her 14th birthday. She loved the camera. This camera is easy to use and is great for a gift for a teenager. I order the black one because that is the color she chooses. This camera has given her tons of fun with her friends.This is a great camera a teenager can put in a bag and take with them when having sleepovers at friends houses. It is small and lightweight and takes great pictures for her to share.I paid full retail price for this camera and this is my honest and unbiased review. ​
My one complaint is that it can't take pictures outside. The lighting has to be 100% perfect to get a good shot. Great for portraits though!
Love it.
Bought for my 12 year old niece and she loves it.  Only downfall is that the "film" is expensive.
Camera is perfect!! Lots of fun to take pictures with.  Everything arrived on time:)
so pretty! contains camera, strap, 2 batteries! easy to operate！
Bought it as a Gift and it doesnt work. Person I gifted it to let me know a little too late and now i cant return it on amazon....
I love it! It's perfect for taking monthly pictures of my daughter. So cute!
I bought this for my wedding, since we were unable to accommodate a photobooth at our venue. Our guest were able to take selfies and glue the pictures to a scrapbook we provided to make an instant "Photo Guest Book".The kids at our wedding had a BALL with this taking pictures of everyone.
Good!
12 year old daughter loves this camera!
Love it, it's so cute.
Very very nice product
LOVE my instax!!
Love........
Came with everything listed and has perfect quality!
Takes wonderful pics. The clarity and color in the film can't be beat. The product is easy to use. It's sturdy and you can move the dial for more options (light exposure etc.). I put the film in backwards once, and worried I damaged something, but everything was fine (no problems at all!) The mini polaroids are fun, and make great party favors or keepsakes too. I love them, fuji is a great product. Highly recommend for the price 50-60$ I wouldn't pay more, but on amazon you  won't. If you're contemplating it, just buy it, you'll love it
I love my Fujifilm Instamax camera!!!!! I have been using this purchase with one that I got to review and it has been the most fun in the world. My son used it to go to DC and we made a little scrapbook for him to keep. My daughter is going to be going on a school trip also and some events in school and I she is going to use to preserve her memories as well. I loved the old Polaroid cameras that were instant, yes i'm that old, but this one is great and new technology. The pictures are pretty sharp and it is not hard to learn to use. The film is a bit pricey, but I love the results so much I just look to buy them in bulk on Amazon. I wish that I had gotten one of these when the kids were younger, it would have been so much fun. Oh, I can't forget to mention the color, I absolutely love this color it is true to the picture and is such a soft canary yellow. Great camera and have quite a few of them.
This Camera is so fun to use!
Such a fun little camera!
Its perfect for capturing the moment!
Bought this for my daughter. She loves it!
Got to my house in time for the GF's birthday. Appeared just as described! Everything worked well and came with batteries.Good: Takes fun instant pictures, not too bulky.Bad: Film is expensive, bad directions
I received this tire inflator and it was not what I expected but I still am happy with it. Not what I needed but a very high quality productPackage arrived on time: Yes the package was on time as promised by seller, I can’t believe that it arrived so fast.Box/Packaging Condition: The box arrived with no damage done to the box or the product. There was sufficient packing materials to keep the product from having any damage done.Price of item: I feel like the product is well worth the price of the item, I would pay retail to order this item again. I can’t believe that such a good quality item is going for this amountLook of item: Just as described and pictured on amazonSize & or weight of item: The item is kind of bulky and heavy but I would expect it from itSmell of item: This item smells of rubberItem used for: Hooking up to an air compressor and checking psi on tiresItem Effects or reactions: Nothing bad to say about productRecommend item: I would recommend this item to anyone who is interested in the product. I have nothing but great things to say and I would be happy to answer any questions that some one interested in buying this product may haveCompare to other brands: This item compares to all other brands I have tried from the expensive to the cheaper ones I think this product is well worth what I paid for the item.Item Satisfaction: I am completely satisfied with this item and so happy I took the chance and purchased it. I still can’t believe that I received this item as such a reasonable price and I am very happy with the item.Received item at a discounted or reduced price for a fair personal honest unbiased review
One the best products I've ever bought! So fun! I love taking pictures.
works great, used it a lot at parties.
The quality of the photos are just okay. Cute & fun product and great for parties.
Great product and quick shipping!
I love this camera! I received it earlier than expected which was a nice surprise. It came with everything shown in the information and it's so easy to set up and use. I would definitely recommend it this to anyone. It's so cute!
Hard to get a good picture outdoors in the sunlight , other than that it is a great camera .
My camera arrived super fast! It was so nice to see my camera in the mail way before estimated delivery day. It came perfectly wrapped and protected in the box. I absolutely love how cute the camera is. I ordered the yellow and it's more of a pastel yellow. It's very lightweight and super easy to use. The camera recommends which setting to use, like if you're outdoors it'll recommend the sunny or super sunny lense (the little sun icon with more rays drawn). The pictures take about 3 mins to develop, pretty fast. The quality is excellent! They are card sized and will fit perfectly in your wallet or whatever you choose. It's a great camera, I recommend it for anyone. I will be buying another one in the future as a gift :)
Glad I got white. It is different but not cheesy looking. Everyone enjoyed this camera at my party.
Best deal I could find and really great quality!
I ordered this for my daughter to give to my 12 year old Grand Daughter ! She absolutely loves it ! She used it within minutes of opening her gifts ! It's a very sturdy camera . Fun for the whole family !Click the button and in a minute you have your instant picture ! Great for Tweens and Teens !Great Gift !Easy to use and load up ! Comes with camera , camera strap , batteriesNew slim camera light weight .Automatic picture exposureNew improved viewfinder great clear crisp picture !Choose your color !My Grand Daughter was very excited about this gift ! Her snapshots are picture perfect !
Best purchase ever! The color is exactly the same as in the photos. The camera is the perfect size, and has a few lighting settings to get your photos perfect! Produced some really great shots!
love it :)
Daughter LOVES the camera.  Have had for several months now...buy extra film!  It's a super cute camera - works well for what it is.  Don't expect any high quality pics...more a fun thing! but GREAT and works well.
Great compact, chunky camera for instant nostalgia!I found this camera very easy to use in spite of English-as-a-second-language instructions. I'm by no means an expert photographer (I took one class in high school 17 years ago and forgot everything but the words f-stop and aperature), but this was easy to use to remember "the good ole days". Even the sound of the flash firing and the film shooting out brings back memories. The flash is always on, which was fine for the indoor setting in which we have since primarily used it. Picture quality is about what you would expect from ye olde Polaroid, and that's just fine for me. I didn't buy this camera to just capture memories--I bought it to MAKE memories.The pictures themselves are small but charming, about the length of my middle finger and less than half as wide as the length. The film shoots out of the camera just like a classic Polaroid and takes about as long to develop as the classic brand did, so be patient if you don't seem your image come through for a couple of minutes. It develops with that wonderful, yellowy vintage sheen that's so appealing to my nostalgia, and because the picture sizes are so small, they make wonderful gifts and be tucked anywhere--wallets, bulletin boards, desk frames.For my part, I bought these for my son's third birthday carnival. You can see in the attached photo that they were part of the giveaways to my guests after they took pictures at our photo wall. My guests went gaga over them. Lots of happy friends that day!
Great
Amazing! Bought this for my daughter, takes amazing pictures and is easy to understand.
I bought the Fujilim intax mini 8 camera as a gift to my friend for her weeding with time in advance,she did not test the camera before and the day of their wedding when they were going to use the camera, but this one didn't work,  they tried with different films and batteries but never works. The camera started to show a red light.
The product works great and is easy to use. I don't like reading directions and I figured it out. Haha. The strange thing about this little camera is where the button to take pictures is. The placement is a little odd and I actually have to think before taking a photo. The photos come out great. I love the size of them!
Shipped and received when supposed to. Wish the polaroids were larger, but apparently this is the new size. Camera is bit heavy, and polaroids are expensive. Read the directions, and then read again before using. We wasted a few polaroids due to careless reading of instructions. Product as described.
I love this new style of fujifilm camera it's perfect for traveling and just packing it on a carry on bag. It takes amazing pictures and its super affordable! Love this
i just wanted to say i received this in less than 24 hours! via PRIMEhow cool is that!great product, have yet to use it, i am bringing it on vacation with me this week
Love this product! Really great way to capture memories!
Fun little camera
I've wanted an instant film camera for as long as I can remember so getting this in the mail was super exciting! It did not disappoint! It feels sturdy and looks so cute and putting in the film is a breeze. It does not come with film so be sure to get that also!It works well and tells you where to adjust the lens according to the lighting. There's also a booklet inside that tells you how to adjust it to be brighter if that's the look you're going for.I had a slight problem with Amazon delivering it past the two day mark (originally 5 days and then down to 3) so just be aware of that if it's for an event like mine was.
First off, I wouldn't recommend buying this camera for large scale family photos or pictures for gatherings. - Which I knew ahead of time by watching product overview videos. I spefically bought this product for cataloging my rock collection since I'm an amateur geologist. Since the photos are small and in HD, it makes it really easy and convenient to tape/catalog photos in a book.
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful is what i have to say! So excited about it and am having too much fun also the film was at a great price for the twin pack! purchased another tiwn pack as well!
I love this camera, it takes great photos.
Love this camera!!!
love this camera. was a great purchase at great price.
As described, A +
Nice camera. Only wish it came with some sample film.
All products were as described and shown in the photos. None of the products were damaged during delivery. All parts worked as stated they would.
Everything
Good quality
Ok
Although the camera came on time and is new it is NOT Fuchsia It came red not what I want and too late to send back.
Wonderful, but dont use in the day time. We tried all the settings the cameral has to offer, but really the photos in the day time came out super washed out. Great photos at night though
This looks more pink in the picture but it's more reddish color. Wasn't too happy about that. Wish I had ordered the light pink.
Stopped working on the second film.
Good camera but when you use the camera outside you have to cover the flash
Great camera. Does what it is supposed to do. Very cute and small
I'm questioning the authenticity of the camera I received in the mail. Its labeling is different than the same caneras you can purchase from big stores like Target or Best Buy.
Pretty good
I love this camera it's so cute ! I was worried after reading some negative reviews but it was worth it I would totally buy it again. The picture come out looking vintage which is an added plus for me!
My 13 yr old loved it!! It's a great camera and would recommend to anyone.
I don't regret getting this. It's very cute and takes nice little credit card sized photos. My issues with it are as follows: the viewing hole is really tiny. The photos come off out of center with the viewing hole. Sometimes the camera recommends settings that make the photos turn out too bright or too dark. & If you try to take closeup photos they will come out blurry.All that aside I love my camera. Being able to take little instant photos wherever I am is just too fun not to enjoy. I love this camera, and if and when they improve it I will probably buy that too.
I love this camera, its small and cute. I bought it as a grad gift to my Baby sister. She uses it all the time, and when its not in use it looks like cute desk decor!
This camera is fun and takes great polaroids. Used at my daughter's graduation party to take pics of all the kids that came! It was the talk of the party!
Just returned from Washington D.C. on vacation, the pictures were very poor in quality, referred to the owners manual and online for help with the settings, same result. Wanted to return it, one week past the return date, figures.
Received package on time, love the red color and am Happy with the item
everything was as expected
good  ok
This polaroid camera was awesome! I absolutely love it to the moon and back! It also ships really fast too! I ordered it on a Tuesday and got it on Friday. I really recommend this polaroid for everyone. It's so amazing that it'll feel like your new best friend! Are you ready to capture a new memory and get it instantly? Don't forget to order your very own Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 polaroid today!
Wife loves it!!! She likes having the picture instantly.
Love it
The first one that came to me had a defect, (the little arm that catches the film and pushes it up to the rollers wasn't working properly). Basically the film wouldn't eject at all. I decided to exchange it and the new one shipped fast and worked perfectly! The new one is so much fun and the return process was smooth. I definitely would recommend!!!
The product sent was defective. Very dissatisfied.
My wife loves this camera, not because it is perfect or because the image quality is tremendous, but because it is a fun experience. It is very easy to use and people are always excited to see the photo that prints out. It's fun, that's the chief benefit of this item.One word of caution, the photo paper is not cheap, so this isn't a carefree experience. We buy the film on Amazon, but even then it is roughly $0.75 per picture.
Just like the old Polaroid's, but with a vintage twist! Love love love! My kids get a kick out of it. They live in the digital age do this is un heard of! Great little shots with it too !
Works great It's so much fun having a instant camera again and these are so much cuter than the ones that were around when I was a kid.
I gifted to my friend and she loves it! only down side that i will say about this is that it doesn't come with the films so i suggest buying the film separately
I took this Camera on a hiking trip today. Although it looks Bulkie it is very lite to carry. Not t going to get high tech photos on this but lots of fun. I can't wait to use it at a kid's party in the photo booth!
Very cute! A bit challenging to master getting ideal photo wuality
A lot of people that rate this product badly, didn't read the instructions well enough. It works great, photos are small, but still cute. Great that it has a exposure meter, helps when taking pics outside. Going to by a white one soon and probably incest in some accessories.
I love instant gratification. Who doesn't? My daddy gave me my first Polaroid eons ago. And while the pictures are nowhere near as good as my digital snaps, and while I have to wait to see if the picture I had hoped to capture is any good - I still love it.The last time I had an instant camera was when my oldest was born - almost 10 years ago. I don't remember if it broke or if procuring the film just got to be too expensive/difficult - but when we moved to Texas, the cameras didn't make it. But in the eerie way our techno age works (and really - it almost wants to make you go off the grid), Amazon started recommending instant cameras again. And when I saw this cute little thing AND in pink - I succumbed.But, as is often the case, I don't fully read all the information before purchasing, I was shocked at how large the camera was when it arrived (despite the fact the actual pictures are super tiny). But it is still cute. And it is still light years better than my old instant camera. It has lens controls that my Polaroids never had.And just as I was amused (awestruck) by the process of watching the pictures develop before my eyes and in my hot little hands - I LOVE that I am able to share that thrill with my babies now.
The color is really pretty, and it works very well!Besides printing pictures, it is also good for decorations.
I overall loved this camera. Only thing is that you have to be careful taking pics in super bright tropical areas because the pics will turn out white if it's really sunny out. No problems with it beside that.
Fun to have 'polaroids" back! This little camera is a lot of fun, but the flash is too bright for the film (using the mfg's film for this camera). It washes out anybody's face and throws off the color balance.
Love it soooo much super cheap and cute I love taking pictures with this!
So happy that I purchased this camera. So much cheaper than in stores. Highly recommend if you are looking for a polaroid camera. It is a little hard to know which lighting setting to put it on, but prascticemakes perfect. I LOVE the color of the camera as well. It is bright and I love it even more because it is matte (which is so in right now)!
Just what I wanted! Though the little part that says how much film I have left might be broken because it's stuck on 9 and I've taken more than 1 photo
Love it
I met my expectations and more
Our 4 yr old grandson is having a blast with his new camera!!!!
I loved the product. It came on time. The only thing I wasn't too happy with was that the strap was missing.
Receive it in mint condition. Works perfectly and durable!
Good item good price My GF likes it!
Loved it! Perfect for guest book pictures at the wedding!
niece loved it.
ok
If you are a woman and wear makeup, white is not the best color to get. My foundation appears to always be on it... and it is not fun to wipe it down after each use. Try another color!
Talk about nostalgia! I had a camera like this when I was a kid and when I bought this for my wedding guest book, I was pleasantly surprised at the joy I had as a kid resurfacing! My little girl and I blew through 20 exposures just playing around and waiting for the picture to darken up. I love this camera and I am so excited to take photos at my wedding with it.
Stopped working after 4 pictures
Perfect
I got this for my cousin for Christmas and she loves it!  The actual color of the camera matches the color in the picture, which I was really happy about.  I bought this product when they had the deal where you can get a free pack of 20 fujifilm instax, so that was a plus!  This product has multiple settings: sunny days, cloudy days, indoors, and nighttime.  This is a perfect gift for teenagers that loves to take pictures
My 11 year old daughter LOVES her camera. Pics are pretty good quality.
Does what it's supposed to do. Great gift. The film is a bit pricey so you really don't get all snap happy but it's a cool gadget
Our daughter purchased this in blue with her "sweet 16" birthday gift money. She loves it and has had great fun taking photos with it. The photo quality is nice, better than the old cameras from years ago. She also found and purchased on Amazon an extra two pack of film to go with this item and it was a great price! This camera was priced competively and we feel she got a fair price after much research. It arrived with the camera, in perfect condition. She carries that camera everywhere now!
Kids love the camera. The film produces great color and last long. Easy to use, fun for the kids and brings back memories of the good old days
25% of the time pictures do not come out at all. Must be a very very close up picture. Quality of the picture is very poor. Please let me know if you would like samples of what the pictures look like. Wish I never bought it.
My inner hipster couldn't resist. I used to love my polaroids. The film just became wayyyy to expensive. They still are. However the instant cameras have been making quite the comeback and with it fuji has made it a little more affordable to enjoy simplistic pictures again. I really love mine and I purchased the black one so that I could customized it to fit my personality. Overall I am super satisfied with this purchase. P.S. Amazon has the best price on these cameras... take my word for it, I have checked.
i lovvvvvvvve it
This product is amazing and is exactly what I expected
I loved it!
My gf loved it!
Smaller than I thought it would be.  But we love it.  Love the "old school" pictures it takes.
I have had the instax wide film camera from Fujifilm for the past three years and this is an amazing improvement. The wide camera is just too large and I look retarded holding it. The instax mini fits very well in my backpack and I'm not scared to be a little rough with it. I like the larger pictures, but this film is a bit cheaper (buy the 60 pack on amazon) so it evens out.
My Mom loves it...I gave it to her for Mother's Day and she is 84 yrs. young !!
Happy
Big hit in our school raffle
I bought it for my daughter. She loves it!
like it really cool to have
The pictures are a little smaller than I thought but they turn out great, just like the old ones. Even my three year old took a perfect picture with it.
My camera is not working, although the batteries are inserted.....
I purchased this camera as a gift and they loved it. The look and the feel of the camera is awesome. I love the way the pictures come out. It's great to make to print out and give to your friends as a gift.
I love how raw the pictures look :) don't expect them to look HD with perfect lighting like your phone provides: but authentic and real. Bringing the old way of taking pictures back and I couldn't love it more!! So cute and compact and super easy to use! With different settings for when it's cloudy or sunny, or you are inside!! Also comes with a selfie lenses so you know you're in the right spot!! Added bonus so you don't accidentally cut half your face off since we are all spoiled and used to front facing cameras now!! Embrace the challenge of mastering a new form of selfie!!
Love this so much. great to take with me to events. the photos are always super flattering and artsy looking. the white gets dirty however, so i would suggest getting a carrier case of some sort
Great!
I love this camera!!
2 out of 10 are duds. When you think you're saving money, you're actually not. But there's no way for us to know until the Polaroid is out.
Bought this for my daughter. Was delivered March 23rd. It is May 9th and it won't work anymore! Should have purchased from a store where I could return it. It is 2 weeks past the 30 day return and I am now out $55 plus the film that is in the camera. Way to go Amazon! I have purchased a lot from Amazon and this makes me so mad that I can't even talk to someone about this.
I notice even while using the proper settings of my camera sometimes the lighting in the photos are dark or too bright. It gives the view of an old photo, though. I enjoy this camera and can't wait to take it to DisneyWorld to take pictures of the kids. I think they will enjoy this photo fun as well!
Great Price. Works great. and received it fast.
So fun for my 12 year old daughter!
I love it!!
Love it! The polaroids come out great and I love the fact that it is so portable and easy to use. The camera allows you to take great photos in all kinds of light and automatically adjusts for lighting conditions. I have it in raspberry and it's a gorgeous colour. The camera feels light in hand and works well.
It took a long time to arrive, the pictures come out poorly.
Great production of photos.  Fun color. Great for teenagers.
This camera takes great mini photos, images are clear, it also comes in many colors.  My daughter loves it!
This camera is amazing . I love it so much 😍❤️
Came really fast! Really cute and works good. Difficult instructions.
Fun!!!!
Love this camera. It's fun and perfect for guest book ideas. Been used for 2 different parties and maybe a wedding in July. It's awesome and my 6 year old loves it too. Easy to use and figure out.
I absolutely love it
Very cute but wished it took better pictures. But they will do what ai need to use them for
Top
Very neat little camera.  Just remember to get in close as the pictures are small.
Everything about it is great!😍
It was great
Awesomeness just like the old Polaroid camera I used to have.
Loved it so much!
was super excited for this product but it doesn't even work.. The camera operation is functional but won't develop any photos.. What's the point??
I am absolutely in love with this camera! Plan to take it everywhere I go. I mainly got this camera to capture college memories and to have them instantly. The film can get rather expensive, but I bought a boundle pack of film of 60 for $30 off Amazon. If you are interested in starting a Polaroid collection I would start with this camera. Although the film is expensive it's cheaper than the actual polariod brand film.
I bought this for my teenage niece. She absolutely loves it. Easy to use and the camera color turned out to be perfect. She takes it everywhere she goes.
Amazing this is my favorite thing ever! Great for scrap booking!
I absolutely love this camera! I got it to use at a bachelorette party so that the bride could have an instant album printed of the night! We then added scrapbook word stickers to each page as the night went on and put each photo into a little album. The bride absolutely loved it! I ended up using it a second time for another bachelorette with the same excitement. My kids love that the pictures come our right away and think its fun to have them to hold on to or give to someone. I wish the film was cheaper, but still think its totally worth it.
Gave this to my 10 year old for her bday.  She LOVES it!  It takes small pictures, about half the size of the classic polaroid I remember.  But it's a cool throwback for the next generation.  Film is a bit expensive, about $1 per picture, but I think I remember it always being that way.  Anyways its pretty cool and my daughter loves it.
everything was fine I didn't have any problems
Ive only had this for about a month and a half and I took it to Disneyland with me and I was ready to take a whole bunch of photos but when I took one, the film wouldnt come out but the number was going down. So I took one more and it still wouldnt come out. I turned it off and on again and took another one, and it finally came out but the picture was really messed up and it was kinda disappointing. Don't know why that happened.
Great birthday present for a love one!
picture quality
Did not take adequate photos outside even on the sun setting
good
I love this camera! I use it alot, and the pictures always come out very vintage looking. Sometimes blurry, but it adds polaroid character! It can be hard to hold on to, and I dropped it once. The side was damaged but luckily it still worked. I highly recommend a case for it!!
Sooooo cute!!! I love the pastel colors and feel of the hard plastic is so good. The size is kinda bulky, so be warned! For 70 dollars this is definitely worth for this product since it comes with some many extras, including  a extre lens.
I LOVE THIS
Worked great for my wedding photo booth. I got two for a back up but didnt need to use it. The colors do turn out dark but it worked out for what I was going for. For clearer photos I recommend getting additional lighting if using at night.
We bought this for our daughter's 10th birthday and she loves it!!!
one of my daughters favorite things!
Color is pretty much exactly as it looks on amazon.com.  The camera was bigger than I expected because I knew the photos were credit card size but that doesn't change my opinion of the actual camera.
Awsome
Super cute!!!
dont know if it was the film or the camera but out of 3 packs of 10 pictures this camera only took 12 pics.
Fun to take pictures at parties.  Kinda have to get use to the viewfinder--- tricky to see through and turning it sideways makes for better landscape photos.
This camera is awesome. The exposures are always spot on when you use the recommended setting. I owned the Instax Wide 210, it was garbage the exposures were terribly inconsistent, plus it was a pain to always have to change the focusing distance. This is just a painless point and shoot camera. And I like the size of the exposures. They're smaller but more cost effective and just as fun. The camera itself is a plasticky toy but, the results are great for parties or family photos.
Obsessed!  Great product.  Very happy with my purchased
First Polaroid camera and have to say this is way cooler than I expected. So glad it was my first pick!
Very nice
So much fun!! My 13 year old loves it. Pretty good quality photos.
This is so much fun to use! It was great idea for birthday party I threw. It wasn't very helpful the instructions, however, because I didn't have much time to read plus it was mainly in another language, I think Chinese. I just found video on youtube on how to use, however, and it's very simple to use.
Ordered for my daughter and she loves it!! You don't "shake it like a Polaroid picture" like the older versions of this camera. Just point and shoot and a few seconds later your picture develops.
Got this for my granddaughter.  She loves it.  Have already had to go for more film.
great quality cane fast happy:)
So cute!
as seen as picture shown, so cute!
Exactly what it is, a fun plastic camera.
I love it
My son loves it and he is 3! It's fantastic. He has no idea what pics are because everything is now stored on phones and computers so to see his face after he takes a pic and to be able to see the pic develope instantly is so fun to watch.
Adorable
excellent
Bought this for my 10 year old niece for her birthday. VERY EASY to set up and operate. Loved the optional packs that were offered to go with this as well. Camera arrived with batteries to my surprise, so we didn't have to make a trip out to get those.Great purchase and will definitely remember for future gifts!
Horrible camera!  I purchased this for my two little girls to take pictures on our trip to Europe so that they could just immediately have the picture and put it in their journal.  We practiced before leaving, and I should have known from that not to bother bringing it along.  No matter what I did (and I read up a lot after having issues), the pictures were either over exposed or under exposed.  Anything we tried to take inside came out black, and the pictures that kinda came out were very grainy and not in a cool, vintage way.  This is not the polaroid I remember from when I was younger.  My kids were very disappointed.  I will be trying to return it as it's totally useless.
Bought it as a gift for my sister, and she really liked it!
Perfect camera
I'm in love with my polaroid camera. I'm so glad I purchased this.
Present for my niece. She loves it!
Very good it came without film so you need to buy some but I love this soooooo much highly recommend it.
love it
i love my camera! no complaints! takes great pictures, it just took me a while to get used to the settings on the camera to take the perfect pictures.
Not too happy with this camera. I bought this as a mother's day gift for my fiance. I gave it to her early because she likes early gifts. I followed all instructions properly and installed the batteries then the film. Every time I would turn the camera on it would print a picture. I took multiple pictures inside and outside. Both turned out black or blank. Wasted a twin pack of film. Do not buy. Terrible, cheap camera.
Very pleased!
I've been wanting this camera for the longest time. I finally got it for my birthday and I love it! Best birthday gift ever, everyone should get it.
I bought Fujifilm Instax Mini instant film 8 Camera ( Raspberry ) made the payment but I did not get the camera to address how I can help with this urgenthttp://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Mini-Instant-Raspberry/dp/B00U2UZ40Y?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4
I bought the camera and all of the accessories as a gift.  Unfortunately it didn't work.  Now that they have replaced it, it works great and my daughter is always snapping pictures!
My daughters loves her camera.  Works great!
Best Polaroid camera out there love the many Polaroids very kid friendly my kids have a blast taking pictures of one another would recommend to anyone quality excellent
Everyone should have one of these, just note it does not come with the film! It prints and develops fast and it's very cute and when youre not using it you can display it on a shelf since its so aesthetically pleasing :)
My top 5 "loves."- Instant photo within 3 mins!- Super easy to use.- Durable, plastic body held up in traveling.- Somewhat expensive film, but worth it having the instant photo.- Light sensor is accurate and compensates accordingly.For reference, I also bought these and they worked wonderfully:Fujifilm INSTAX Mini Instant Film Twin Pack (White)Fujifilm Instax Mini Instant Film, 10 Sheets of 5 Pack × 2 (100 Sheets)5/5 stars.
I got this for fast, fun, and informal pics for parties and events and it's been perfect in that regard. Plus, it's damn good looking and works like a charm.
I got this camera as a gift for my daughter and it's already a favorite. Lots of precious memories. LOVE IT.
Love it.
A fun, easy to use camera with exciting results.
I purchased this camera for my daughter as a birthday gift, she is 13 now.She really likes this camera mind you it's not like my Cannon Rebel or even my iPhone 6splus camera but for a teenager it's perfect.The kids love watching the pictures fade in much like the old Polaroid camera I owned as a kid. It's like magic for my 5 year old granddaughter watching the picture appear.The only negative thing I can think of is the pictures are much better in brighter light. The flash is just not that bright.
the product arrived in perfect condition
I bought this for my girlfriend as a birthday present and she is in love with it! She likes how simple it is. Good buy!
This camera is awesome and easy to use however it often has small issues such as printing blanks and the pictures coming out very light, to the point where half the photo is just white. The photos taken in darker settings come out amazing though
Fun camera!  Works well.  Looks great!
Love the camera! Fun to use!
I have always wanted a polaroid camera and I absolutely love this newer version. It's light and compact enough that I can take it anywhere. It's perfect for capturing memories since I often forget to get my photos printed. This way I don't have to remember!
Awesome camera. Great for anyone who scrapbooks. Got as a part of a bday for my fiancé. She loved it.Make sure you buy plenty of film! 👍🏽
Gift item, really.  But fun.  Film cost a bit.
good
Great
I love this, I always take pictures.
I love this camera - color is gorgeous (more of a coral than the raspberry pink shown in picture). It is super easy to use, but if you don't have your camera on the right setting, it will be either washed out or way too dark. I'm giving this 5 stars because I just got it a week ago so I'm figuring the minor problems I'm having are just because I'm a beginner :)
Have only used it inside so far and the automatic lighting setting has worked perfectly. Can't wait to see how it works outside, I have the instax wide and I have to say it doesn't always take the perfect photo.
I just received the camera and I am in love with it. It was really easy to figure out. I used it instantly and the picture came out great. I wish the picture would be a bit smaller but this way is also great since I do a photo book for my son. The pictures are small enough to fit many on one page. The best part is that I don't have to wait an hour at Walgreens to print a picture or several. I hope that it does last and it is not some cheap camera.
It fell in water the day that I got it! Very disappointing!
I love this camara. I use it for special moments with family and friends
Included in the package:/Strap/Instruction manuals/a pair of batteries/the cameraOne review said it came with a close up lens, but it does not, sadly :( Also, the strap cannot adjust. As in, you cannot make it tighter or looser, which is a downside in case it slips.It's easy to insert film (which you have to buy separately) and came on time. I can't wait to use it! I saw one of my friends with it and it takes very cute, neat pictures so I thought I should get one too. Some of her pictures turn out really bright/white though, so settings will have to be played around with. The instruction manual kind of guides you on what settings to use depending on the lighting/background.There was no damage to the box or the camera. The  camera is easy to use and is compact enough to fit in my small hand. It's light and lean, but since I got a powder blue camera I have to be careful not to get it dirty. True to picture and descriptions!I used to have the Polaroid land instant camera and it was large and bulky plus the film was expensive. I was happy to get the Fujifilm instax 8 camera. The credit card sized pictures are cute and can be decorated around the edges. There are also many accessory kits available for this model camera.
Daughter loves!
The half pack of film do not work! I I don't know what's wrong?
Bought this for my daughter's 11th birthday. She loves it! Couldn't be happier! Good price compared to others we've seen.  I do want to mention that we had horrible delivery though. We used same day delivery and the driver was terrible. He actually throws the box at our door.
Super cute and easy to use. Look up videos if you know nothing about how to work one of these or for some tips, there are incredibly helpful ones on youtube! I have been wanting one of these for so long, and this price is unbeatable. Highly recommended. Can't wait to use this for my trip to Mexico in June. Happy shopping xx (:
Good seller, excellent product
Loved this camera, I got one as a gift, and then I decided to purchase this one for a friend and she loves it! The color of the camera is gorgeous and it works great!
Arrived on time and undamaged. Took it to the beach with me and it was able to withstand heat and sand without any damage. Takes super cute pictures that come out around the size of a credit card. Perfect for scrapbooking.
Looks more like orange, not raspberry. Disappointed.
Gift for the special teen in our lives.  She loves this thing to death.  I was surprised to see it took nice quality mini pix.  I stocked her up on lots of Fuji film, so she can snap away.  Kind of nice for the teens, then they have something in addition to the digital photo.  I also got the accessory kit, so she was in teen heaven.  Much more compact than the old fashioned polaroids and ten times more fun to use.
I love my camera, I've taken it to many different cities across the country and love being able to physically document my trips. You only get one chance at a photo and it's really nice to have that aspect back in my life compared to all the technology out there.
Is a funny camera not such a good quality but ir works very well
Great and fun camera but I thought the color was going to be closer to pink but it's like a matte red.
Bought this as a gift for my teenage niece. She loved it! She takes it everywhere and snaps pics of everything.
Love it
My sister really likes it.  It was a perfect gift
My daughter LOVES this camera. The pictures come out better than the old Polaroid, in a more-rectangular shape. Quicker, too. The film is a little pricey but still less expensive than other brands.
Came in great condition and was easy to use. It even had batteries already in it. Just make sure you read the instructions before loading pictures so that you dont ruin the pack. Thanks
The camera doesn't take photos. All prints turn out white. Amazon hasn't responded to any of my product issues. I wouldn't buy!!
works well
My son likes it.
Nice
Waist of money.
The camera works great and i love the little photos!!
I am so obsessed! this little thing is my new best friend! If you are thinking about buying it, you should totally buy it!
I spotted this camera in my local craft store but wasn't willing to buy it for the outrageous price in the store.  I love this little camera! When I was a kid, Polaroid instant cameras were all the rage so this version from Fujifilm is just as great. The battery cover comes on and off easily, loading the film is easy to do as well.  This is a nice little camera to have fun with. You can change settings whether you are indoors or outdoors, the camera actually suggests the setting to use.  The own downfall for this camera is that you have to keep in mind that the view finder is off to the right.  So while you may have your subject in the center through the finder you do have to compensate a little bit so that your subject is in the center when the film pops out at the top. Otherwise this is a great little camera to have especially for the trip down memory lane and also for those moments where you want to capture something right away and let people walk away with an instant memento.
LOVE IT
It didn't come with the film that it said it would, but it did arrive on time. A little disappointed.
I bought this to send pictures to my fiancé in marine corps boot camp and I love it! I'm going to use it at his graduation and our wedding! Only downside the film is so expensive!
Its cute and it does what I want. Things to note however! The pictures takes a minute to develope, they pop out white and blank. Don't assume its broken! also don't take pictures in the mirror, silly me did and have some lovely ruined film for my trouble.
Great gift, my grandaughter loves it
I love it. it is so cute and picture quality is great! I would buy this again!
LOVED IT WORTH THE MONEY
Works great..my 13 year old loves it
Comes exactly as shown, color is satisfying.
Arrived as described, on time and in complete working order (took 3 photos so far). Attached a Kata strap (good quality choice) and plan to take it on my many adventures in the future! Light weight and super easy to use. This model has shooting features that are great for an instant camera! Who knew we could do so much with an instant mini? Loving it so far and I even got a few other people to purchaee their own!
Settings aren't working and I've had the camera for a very short amount of time. Disappointed.
Camera came in a timely manner; rather quickly and it looks just as described. The camera came in its original package along with batteries and a manual. (I only ordered the camera itself.) It's exactly what I needed but it's not vintage.
Mine didn't work sadly. All the pictures came out extremely dark. I was able to return it for a full refund though which is why I left 2 stars.
Perfect
My daughter loved this.  You actually have to teach them how to take a picture by lining up things in the view finder...but she loved having the pictures right away.  We bought it for her birthday and she was able to give her friends pictures at the end of the party.
LOVE! Took this to Miami with me and made a bulletin board with pins thought the trio! Only downfall is it only holds 8 photos & you HAVE to adjust the lighting on the lense or your photo will be solid white!
I am very satisfied with the product. My daughters love it and use it regularly. Only wish the film (cartridges) were less expensive.
These are so cute! But totally junk! purchased one and will not take photos 2 came out ok then the rest are blank...returned and received a new one...first photo came out with white blotches and the rest are white and a few that are totally pale yellow. what a waste! I am returning the second for a full refund and going to purchase a digital camera for my daughter.
I love this little blue camera! I always get fascinated looks when using it and people always smile when they see the film come out right after the picture is taken. I gave it 4 stars as it is great but the device could have so many more improvements and I hope Fuji uses it's success to work on designs and concepts for the next version. Often times the sensor will change like crazy and one moment you are on the right one then the next you take the picture and it is overexposed or too dark. Also it is hard sometime to center the picture as the viewfinder is off to the side and not closer to the center but I always go based off the lenses, but for people not used to the camera they tend to be off the first few tries if you are trying to get them to take a photo for you. Overall great product, warning though the film is pricey so use it wisely.
Takes great photos and selfies!!!
Loved it!
Great idea for scrapbooking and easy to use! My daughter loved it!
Supper fast shipping.!!! Loved my camera & it came with film so pleased.!
Adorable
overpriced instant film cameras pfftt  -_____-
Don't have to wait for film to come back, Perfect.
Bundle price was a great deal. Arrive at the front end of delivery schedule and pictures came out great
I'm in love with the camera, I wish the pictures were larger but they are ok. Also the color of the raspberry one is not like the one on the product pictures, is more like a coral color, it's reddish! I liked it anyway :)
Great instant photo camera for my 9 year old!  She loves it.
Works well and was a hit as a gift. Pictures it takes are neat.
Sent as a gift to my sister and she loved it. Picture quality one of the finest out there.Easy to use and other decent colors available.
Super fast shipment and great product.
very small, perfect for a gift!
What's a party without memories. Tons of fun!
My daughter loves this camera!
As good as shown
My daughter loved it
LOVE IT!!!
Pictures are terrible.  I thought they would be at least as good as the old Polaroid.... not even close.  My daughter took 6 pictures on her birthday - 2 of them didn't even print (but, combined with the next picture she took).
I bought this for my 7 year old who loves to take pictures and thought he should have a hardcopy of his own. The camera came within 2 days of my order and it was perfect. The pictures are clear and look great. The size is definitely not that of the Polaroid pics of my childhood but it's still a good size. He loves the camera so much and I find myself using it as well. Great purchase and will definitely be buying it again as gifts.
I love my camera!
Great camera! Not the best for landscapes but awesome for close ups and party pics
This camera is my new baby,  it's  so simple to use and has great  quality.  There are a few different settings that you can use.  The only downside is that the flash goes off no matter what setting you set it at,  but that is an easy  fix: just cover the flash up ad you're all set! Just a heads up,  the film, is a little  pricey,  but you can get it for a little  cheaper online.
Awesome! Thanks!
Pictures turn out great and I love the color!
great
Awesome item!!!
This camera is great. So much fun. this is the second one that I have purchased. The first was for myself and the second was a gift to a 17 year old. Very reminiscent of the old polaroids.
Easy to use and adorable.
Exactly as described
This camera is all what I was hoping it would be.  Easy to use , clear pictures and perfect size for my 8 year old niece.  This was a birthday gift to her and she loved it!  The film is a bit pricey, but I bought a four pack on Amazon and saved quite a bit of money that way.  My niece goes through lots of film!  It's been dropped more than a few times and has held up quite well.  I'm happy with the purchase.  I ended up buying another one.
Really love it
LOVEEE IT!! the yellow is such a cool faded shade!! Shipped and arrived fast, easy to use and works greaaaatttt!!! It exceeded all expectations!! 100% worth the money!!
This camera is life. I'm sooo happy to have purchased it. It was a steal as I know that in other stores such as Urban Outfitters sell it for 100+ tax... 55 sure isn't a problem for me. Anyway, I am extremely excited for this particular purchase because I had always wanted a polaroid but just now had the opportunity to get one. The camera is very cute and easy to handle; in addition, it's also very convenient and surprisingly simple to use. The film for it is a bit on the pricey side but worth it. Your pictures come out so nice and pretty. I definitely recommend this product for anyone who loves to take pictures and want your camera to look fun and adorable at the same time! I adore it and I think you will too.+ the shipping for this product only took a day... knowing I am an impatient person, this is such a great add on.
I got this as a gift for my boyfriend whose a photographer, and he loves it! Sometimes the photos come out a little overexposed, but you have to toy with it a little to get the perfect lighting. Since I got this product used, it was a little dented up and the lens cover is a little uneven. It still works great and is a very awesome, fun gadget!
It's cute, not top quality.
Obviously I'm spoiled by point and shoot cameras but I find it hard to get the right amount of lighting for a good photo. Something is always too dark or too light. Very fun novelty though. Great for handing a photo to a friend or stranger since they are already printed unlike other photos.
Yes
Excelent!
as expected granddaughter loves itHate the pricey film
So far we have used 1 package of film and no photos have turned out.
I love this camera
Great price and fun for the kids
Great product
Love this camera super cute!
excellent
Everything met my approval.
My 11 year old daughter loves her new camera.  It takes pretty good photos compared to the old polaroid cameras we had in the 80's.  It definitely feels like it is cheaply made.  I feel like if it gets dropped, it wouldn't survive.  It will be going on a trip shortly, so we will see if it comes back in one piece.
Shipped quick, just as described, very happy with this purchase.  Thanks.
Fun and inexpensive
Im so stoked to start using thanks
takes wonderfull pictures
This is so fun best camera for clubbing or birthday parties.
awesome
Arrived on time, product exactly as described.
I love this camera so much! It is very durable and the quality is wonderful. I absolutely recommend this item to anyone thinking about an instant camera.
GREAT
Fabulous
Favorite camera. Hard to figure out the exposure settings, but you'll get it!
Had this at my wedding and it was a lot of fun and easy to use.  Great quality pictures, just make sure you have the right setting on.
This is so cute. I have absolutely no complaints about this product. I's a little bigger than the mini 8. comes in such a cute bundle.
My younger daughter loves hers. Getting the older daughter one for her birthday. Very fun to use and the color is great!
Came exactly as pictured! Love the vintage look of the photos. Super light and easy to use
Got the camera this afternoon and it works awesome! :D I'm super stoked to bring this on vacations and hang outs with me and take polaroid worthy pictures. (:
This camera is amazing, works like a charm. I love the pink design. I brought it to a wedding and it was a hit! It does take some trial and error getting the lighting just right. I wish the image size was a standard Polarioid size, this is slightly smaller.
Great camera!
Works perfectly!!! It is so great for my 9 year old!
I love this camera.
She loved this. It was late.
I love this instant camera! I use it all of the time! It's great quality and gives me so much joy!
Bought it for my little sister and she loves it!!!
Fun camara! Worth the buy! A little bulky but still pretty awesome! Takes cute picture and the quality is good. Just don't take pictures in the direct sunlight because it won't turn out as well!
I love this instax mini, I love it so much I bought the pastel yellow. Great cam!
Great size and color for teens! Super picts too!
Great color and easy to use.
I LOVE THIS CAMERA OMFG!! SO GREAT!
Its a good product
It's really nice. Bought this for my daughter for her 12th birthday.
Got this for my friends baby shower!!! Loooooove it! Works great. Big hit!
Love it
Very nice clear lens and comes with batteries so that was nice ! Only thing missing is the film ! Cute little camera I got it for my hubbys birthday
Awesome. My 9 year loves it for instant prints of pictures she takes.
it's cute and fun to use, but the film gets expensive if you get carried away - i think this is a great idea for scrapbooking, it gives a retro and fun look, but just for everyday use - then no, your phone is better!
Cute camera.. trendy.. my 8 year old loves it. I recommend getting a case for it. we did.
Reminds me of the Polaroid cameras I grew up around, but the pictures are photo booth size. Makes for a great novelty item.
daughter loves it. She wanted this for her birthday and as soon as she got it she was snapping away. pictures everywhere!
Amazing photo quality and really cute camera
Maddy loves her Polorid camera.
This little Mini * FugiFilm Instax Camera was a huge hit at my daughters birthday party. I actually bought this as a gift for her for her Birthday and everyone there went nuts over it along with her.This camera is small and uses the instax mini FujiFilm which is so cute, they are fun size photos that are perfect to carry in your purse or wallet. She actually sent a photo of herself with her daddy when he went on a fishing trip for good luck.This Camera is perfect for kids and adults as well. I actually bought some accessories to go with this and they make the whole photography experience so fun.It is really easy to use, your film comes out instantly and that is one of the other things that makes this camera so great. Once the picture comes out you will need to let it develop which takes no time at all.There is a dial on the front of the camera to get accurate settings for what your are taking pictures of. There is a flash on this cute little camera and it produces nice clear photos.At first i thought this was a little pricey but i am so happy i decided to go ahead and purchase this, it is one of her most prized pieces and i will add she has a cell phone and game systems but takes better care of this than any of those. Great buy!
We bought this for our 7 year old daughter on her birthday. She loves it. It's easy to use and she gets the benefit of seeing her photo right away. Nice color too.
so good
Kids love it, age 11.Complaints they had:-no manual in the box.-high cost instant film.-just decent pictures.
I love this camera. My niece has one that we bought locally. After playing with hers, I had to get one for myself! It's durable and stands up to my toddler carrying it around the house (I don't let her take pics), and has gone on several outings. I purchased on Amazon because the price couldn't be beat! Was able to buy the camera and film on Amazon for the same price as just the camera locally. The photo processing is similar to what it was back in the day, except no need to shake the pic:)
This camera is SO very retro fun.  My elementary-aged kids have never experienced a Polaroid, so this was incredibly unique to them!  Amazing that you get a picture right there!  The quality is that of an 80's Polaroid, so don't expect perfection, but for the novelty we love it.  The film can get expensive, but a three-pack outlasted the kid's attention span for several weeks.
Super cute! Whenever I use it around kids they all want one, lol. Heck, so do their parents! Easy to use, comes in different colors, and so much fun! :)
My câmera doesn't work! It doesn't worth the money
It's a different experience taking pictures that you instantly get to hold and share with physical friends. The camera is well made and designed. The quirky look and color encourage a playful mood for snapping shots. The lighting sensor is great, and having to manually switch the setting lends to the creative process of crafting that perfect print.
It's nice to have the pictures come out instantly, but the turning piece in the front that helps with the lighting doesn't really work. If I turn it, it doesn't change to the setting it is supposed to. Also better on not so sunny days, I tried to take a picture at the zoo, and all I got was a white picture because it was too bright and I couldn't change the settings or anything.
I've always wanted a poloriod camera, and this was the best gift to myself. I love the little pictures that comes out or it. It's also a comfortable hold in the hand. I would totally buy this for someone
Love it
Nice camera
I was VERY pleased with my camera. It takes wonderful pictures and is very easy to use.
My girlfriend loves this!
It's been great so far can't really take photos from a distant but it's still good. My daughter was very happy she got it for Easter.
just received this product using FREE ONE DAY SHIPPING!! As soon as i got my instax i FELL IN LOVE with it. Definitely a great buy. DO NOT buy the instax from urban outfitters or free people. Just know that the color is  LITTLE MORE GREEN THAN BLUE so i would recommend some stickers to put on your instax to personalize it. I used "Kiss my patch" stickers which are super cute patch stickers. Really would recommend this product.
Cute camera and a classic to have at parties. Everyone loves a polaroid
Love it
My daughter is having so much fun with this camera! And I love the blue color.
I love this product. I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend but after receiving it in the mail and taking it out of its packaging I fell in love with it. For a relatively cheap product it is excellent quality that feels good in your hands and is very easy to operate. It came with two double AA batteries that are simple to put in and for an additional cheap price it came with two 10 picture cartridges that are easy to install. I would recommend buying the case for this product, not because its flimsy or not put together well but because it would be such a shame to see such a valuable product damaged. This is an all around great product that is great as a gift or for anyone interested in casual photography. I give this product five stars.
Definitely an amazing purchase. Love the color and it takes pictures very clearly. I got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it!
nice camera. no problems what so ever
Beautiful !!!!
Glad I purchased it can't wit to actually use it!
My daughter loves it. Picture quality is as expected for something like this. It would be nice if the pictures were a little bigger. Don't expect the same size as old polaroids. These are about half the size and film is expensive at about $1/picture. Fun novelty item or gift for a teen.
My niece loves this camera! Good quality and so much fun to use!
great
Cute and quirky.  Requires some practice to get a good photo which is normal. The pics are smaller than I expected but adds to the charm and overall fun.
So much fun
This is such a fun camera. My daughter loves it and it actually takes nice pictures.
xmas gift
So cute and just as I expected! Still working on lighting for the best picture quality but nonetheless I'm happy with my purchase. Look around for pricing. After purchasing I did see it cheaper elsewhere. Not on Amazon but a retail store. Regardless I love my new camera.
Birthday gift for granddaughter. She loves it.
Love
Purchased this for a photo booth and it was a HUGE hit!
I love the camera, but unfortunately the strap is missing.
Love This Camera , Takes Great pictures, AWESOME!!!
Love it.
Works great, my wife loves it!
Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend over Christmas, and it works amazing!
My daughter absolutely loves this camera. Bought for her 13th birthday. Pairs really well with the camel colored carrying case!
I bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday and she claims that she loves it. I have used it multiple times and have a couple of complaints. When taking photos inside, this camera works really well and takes good pictures. If your outside and it is sunny or at least a little sunny, the camera can not take good photos. They are always washed out no matter what setting you are on. You can barely get an image on the "super sunny" setting. I think polaroids are awesome, but I don't think this one is something I would buy again or even recommend.
works great
Camera did not work correctly and wasted two rolls of film. But, returned easily and quick to give credit.
Fun camera.  Some younger kids are amazed with the instant picture that pops out. Very fun
Amazing and loving it.....
Great camera my daughter loves it!!!
as described quick shipping
My daughter loves this camera. But it's over priced and the film is outrageously expensive. I just paid 65 for the camera and two days later it's 55.
My son used this camera in Ecuador when he went on a mission trip. He stated that it was the right size, and the picture came out beautiful. When he returned home, he was absolutely correct. The pictures were amazing. I will recommend this product to anyone, especially when space is a concerned.
Fantastic camera!
Such a cute camera loveeeee the color it's light weight and sleek. Easy to operate and gives the vintage look of photos I've been looking for. Definitely a must have product!
Great camera for a great price. The quality is also really good.
Great product. Love my camera
I can't give much a review on how well it works yet as I just got it but I'm a little disappointed in the color. I ordered raspberry thinking it was a dark pink but it is not. It's red. Very red. Wish I had known that or I would have ordered the lighter pink one.
Fun little camera!
So much fun :) love it
Just got this today, so can't review on how good it holds up, but I really like it so far! Seems easy to operate and easy instructions with pictures on loading.  It came with batteries (which is cool, didn't notice it said that in the description) The color is deff more of a red than pinkish how it looks on the picture, unfortunately (well, unless you love red!).  I was thinking from the picture it was more of a deep rose pink, really it just seems nearly red, to me. Oh, well, still happy :) :)
It's a modern day Polaroid.....fills a niche
I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift and she loves it. She has had no issues with it at all. We use rechargeable batteries in it because it will go through batteries with heavy use. On a side note, what I don't like is the cost of the film and would have liked this to have been a digital camera, so keep that in mind when deciding on this camera but it has nothing to do with how it works. It takes very good pictures from my perspective and that is this is a child's toy camera.
I have no idea why my wife wanted this, but she did and I got it for her as a gift. Pictures must be taken in near perfect lighting conditions to come out nicely. I'm sure the novelty will wear off of this soon and it'll find its way to the bottom of the junk drawer.
My daughter had to have this for her 11th birthday. An instant camera... really? Well she's had to have many things before but this is something she seems to love. After almost a year, It's been on two vacations with us and on many outings. Her bedroom walls are filled with Polaroids taken with her favorite camera. She says she rates this 5 stars.
Been eyeing these cameras for a while. I'm re-doing my room and I want to make a Polaroid photo board of all my favorite people, places, and things. Got this for about $60. Love the color and how simple it is to use.I mean, the film is expensive as can be, but you should know and accept that before buying an instant camera anyway. :)
Very easy to use and takes high quality pictures.
My 11 year old daughter got this camera for Christmas and didn't use it until we went on a beach vacation this month.  Of the two rolls of film we purchased, only one picture she took actually developed.  All the others remained white/blank.  We adjusted brightness setting, etc., to no avail.  She was SO disappointed, it became a major bummer during our trip (she kept trying and trying, based on that one picture that worked).  This is a serious hunk of junk, regardless of how cute it looks.  Absolute waste of money. BTW, I haven't written an online review of anything in five years - this is a testament to how unhappy I am about this purchase.
As expected; wonderful and fun. Much better price than in stores. Love it!
Excellent product!SUPER FAST s/h! Thank you
Love the color!
My 12 year old daughter has wanted one for a very long time, and I purchased it for her for her last birthday. Very competitive pricing which is always a bonus. Seems durable and seems to be high quality.I personally do not like how small the pictures are, they seem slightly pointless to me. But my daughter likes it, it's the 'cool' thing to the kids!
Purchased for my daughter. She loves the instant photos and quality is fairly good.
My friend loved it! it just sucks you have to buy the film separate which is pretty expensive.
cute and fun, but a little cheaper than I expected.  It was fun for the grandkids, but they need supervision so they won't break it.  The film is a bit pricey.
I love these little cameras! I have gifted two of them already to some friends, and they are equally as in love with them!The blue color displayed in the photos is identical to the actual color of the camera. So far, my friends have had no complaints regarding how well the cameras work. Mine is a different color, but since that's just a cosmetic difference, I'll give my personal opinion of my camera.Ease of Use: 4/5 This camera is SO easy to use. While the gist of it is "point and shoot", you may find that your photos are slightly un-centered and off to the left if you solely rely on viewing through the viewfinder. A helpful tip I've mentioned to my girlfriends is that when you think your photo is centered perfectly, adjust your camera ever so slightly to the right, and they will turn out beautifully! Also, make sure to adjust the lighting settings to whatever the camera prompts you to select. If you forget to do this, your photos will almost definitely turn out too dark, or overexposed - and film is NOT cheap!Set Up: 5/5 Super easy to set up. Literally all you do is insert the included batteries. Reading the instructions is very helpful when you're inserting your film for the first time, so make sure you don't throw them away!Price for Quality: 5/5 This camera is worth every penny. It's the cheapest by far on Amazon. While it's also sold at Michael's and Urban Outfitters, they'll charge you upwards of $100/$200, when you can easily buy it online for less. This camera is an investment. Buying film will be the most costly part of owning it, but if you hunt around and compare prices, you can easily find packs of film that save you a few bucks.I adore this camera. Since owning it, I've found that I'm much more selective when taking photos. I won't just take pictures of random things anymore since the film only comes in packs of 10 sheets. I love that the photos print right away, and they're so easy to display and give to people. My camera is always a hit at parties and when we're on vacations. It saves me from having to use up my phone battery while constantly taking pictures, which is definitely a plus! It's very small, and not at all a nuisance to carry around. I purchased a case for it, and have purchased the same cases as an included gift with their cameras. I definitely recommend buying yourself a case and an attachable selfie mirror to go along with this camera!
At first I was displeased because it was not working, but to my luck I got it working. Now I'm super excited and extremely happy with my Fujifilm camera.
This camera is the best! Got it just in time for Easter weekend. Definitely recommend this product!!!!!
So I purchased this camera for my niece that lives in Cali and I gave it to her when we went on our trip to Hawaii and after it took 10 pics the camera just stopped working & I thought let me buy new film maybe it's the film ... Nope waste of 40 bucks on the film cause it didn't work . & I bought the camera ahead of time so I wouldn't have to worry about her gift later and then the camera just stopped working & because of the 30 day return policy I can't return it .. I should've opened it and made sure it worked cause now I wasted a 100$
Im feel so good with it I love it
I'm so glad to see that they brought back the instant camera.  This was a gift and the recipient was so pleased.  I checked out all the different brands and decided that fujifilm was my best choice. And it does take great pictures.  I chose white and the camera itself had a good "feel" to it.  Nice quality and takes really good pictures.  I wish the photos were just a bit larger though.  Of course, the camera would probably be larger too.  We like the compact size.
Too exspecive for something this small and crappy, it's very slippery when you try and hold it. Didn't have th color I wanted in stock....film is very exspecive...hard to find the film in the stores
It came a week early! and was in amazing condition. I absolutely love it and can't wait to take prom pictures with it!
I really like the camera per se, but the specific one that I received had signs of wear. The compartment where the film is placed does not lock completely, which does not affect the performance but it looks awful in a brand new camera. It also had little (but annoying) black stains that I couldn't take away. I am not taking away more stars, even though I should, because the camera is just awesome and I've taking photos like crazy. It reminded the materiality of traditional photography, which is something that we tend to ignore due to digital photography. Being able to look at the process of the chemical record of the light in these photographs is so interesting and fun. I am currently writing one chapter of my doctoral dissertation on analogue photography, so this camera has been the best idea for my procrastination time. Overall, I recommend the product but not the seller.
The best purchase that I've done so far!
I love it! The only downside was film isnt included but i bought it separately. Its so cute and love the color i recommend this too others who want one.
So I just got my camera yesterday and took it out to the park. I really love it. I have a Polaroid 600 camera that I was using before, but this compared to that is so much nicer. The camera itself has a fresh, clean and easy to use look to it. The instructions come in a ton of different languages, but English was easy to find and were simplified in easy how to instructions. Polaroid 600 was a thrifted camera and it was hard to get used to. The insta max camera includes a wrist strap which made the camera easy to carry around tha park. The Polaroid 600 is a neck strap which hurts after an hour. Once I took an insta max photo it came out quietly and quickly. Polaroids always came out loudly. Also with my Polaroid camera it was always a hit or miss with the quality of the photos, but my insta max mini has given me nothing but great ones. I'm very glad I made the swap from that camera to this one. It's will defiantly be on me at all times.
HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A YEAR NOW. LOVE IT SO MUCH! ALTHOUGH THE FILMS ARE EXPENSIVE, BUT STILL WORTH IT!
Got this for my mother for mothers day I know she is going to love it thank you :)
Great camera, but all the instructions come in Japanese,  my daughter had to watch a few youtube video to make sure she was installing the film right the first time.
Came way earlier than expected and was undamaged. Camera works great.
10 yr. old Daughter loved instant photos
Awesome and fun little camera- super fast shipping too!
Product quit working and it is April 2nd. Tried to return but says it is not eligible. Do not spend your money on this and risk it not working after 2 months.
love it
This little camera is so cute and perfect for tweens!
Absolutely cool camera, bought it for simple use. Surprised how much fun me and the gf have had with it. I havent purchases the special film with designs but the standard gives a classic look.Turns on kinda simple, one push button. Took a second for me to realize that the different lighting options are on the lens. The camera senses the lighting and lights up the most appropriate option.Side notes: Photos are ruined if the flash reflects of a window. Runs on Double AA, insert the film and leave it closed because the "PHOTOS REMAINING" counter resets when the flap opens. You cant upload photos online, weird right? But kinda awesome if you dont want people to see them.
I absolutely LOVE this camera. Super cute, easy to use. Does not come with film, you have to buy that desperately. Great buy, a little expensive but its overall a great camera & gift!!! Totally would recommend.
I absolutely love my Instax! The pictures are cute and vintage looking... Perfect for scrap booking! I take it with me on trips and special occasions and then post my pictures on a corkboard. One downside is the pictures are kind of small but that's not a problem unless you have more than three or four people in the photo. Found out a few days ago how durable this camera was. I forgot it was in my backseat and a bunch of muddy rowdy kids stepped all over it. I just wiped it off and it worked perfectly fine. I highly recommend it's worth the buy!
Brought this for a gift in the end wanted it for myself. Pictures are really great!!! Amazing camera!!!
So amazing and cute love love love it. It came super fast and was such a great price. I wanted one for the longest time and was going to buy one at urban outfitters for $100 so glad I looked around first. Definitely satisfied. Will definitely be buying more as gifts.
In love with my camera!!
I love this camera! For a reasonable price, I think that this camera works great and is very fun to use. I've traveled with it (so I do wish it was slightly smaller) but still fits fine in a large bag. I didn't purchase any case or protective gear for it, and it is still perfectly intact. The quality of the photos is great. I didn't read any of the instructions and figured out how to use it (but probably could learn more about some of the features), so overall pretty foolproof. I like that this particular model is popular enough that you can find a lot of other accessories out there (leather sleeves, photo albums, wood picture holders, etc.). It's really fun to use and I like the white color, which hasn't gotten dirty yet, despite all my travel and throwing it into the main compartment of large purses. Would recommend this.
This camera is absolutely AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! The picture quality is far better than I expected. The camera is a good size, fits in my hand perfectly. It is easy to use. It has different settings, for outside and inside,
good
I like it but only downfall is that if your outside and there's even the slightest of light, the pictures come out bright!!
Works fine and I love how it looks!
This camera has been so much fun so far. I used it on Easter, I use it casually, I use it for anything and everything. It's great for the lazy scrapbooker like myself who does not have time for printing :)
My 13yo daughter got this and loves it. The pictures are smaller than the old polaroids, but cool. She did buy a case to go with it. It does seem durable. The film is pricey though. Overall, Amazon had the best price for a cool blast from the past.
Films expensive , quality of photos very questionable. Other than that, good.
Love
sensitive to light, so you have to be sure and not be in too bright of a room when taking pics.
Bought it for my grand daughter and we had so much fun using it. Pictures are really good.
great price fast delivery good quality  present for my 7 y/o granddaughter, nice starter camera, but film is expensive
Got this for my daughters 11th birthday. She loves it! Being able to have a print right away is amazing to her. It is a good quality camera and other than explaining to her what the settings should be in different types of lighting, there has be no difficulty. And that is only minor.
The product is great. Just what I expected.
My gf lovedd it!!
It's perfect!!
The Fuji film is awesome! Great quality!!
A little pricy for a piece of plastic. But she likes that the pics print out right away. Although the size of the pics is much to be desired.
For a Polaroid it is not bad.  Pictures are small,put the kids love it
Excelent
Absolutely love this camera! Very durable! I've dropped this camera once and still worked great!! A little tricky to get the hang of but over all the camera itself is wonderful! Definitely recommend for any photography lovers like me! Really captures the moment
awesome camera my kiddo loved it and used all the film the first day, easy to use easy to reload film.
Fast delivery, I ordered this 2 nights ago and it already came in even with free ground shipping! The camera is so cute, can't wait to try it out!
Really awesome camera and much fun. Buying film isn't though. But that's how instant cameras are. Still awesome
My daughter is in love with this camera. We purchased it for her for her 8th birthday. While I wish there was more film in each pack to take pics. this camera is absolutely amazing and brings me back to my childhood with poloraid cameras.
WELL THANKS FOR YOUR HELP MY DAUGHTER IS HAPPY,
Works great and my daughter loves it
Gave as a gift, she LOVES it.
Awesome product
Not good for outdoor pictures in bright light or pictures from a distance. Works very well for indoors, up close pictures
Fun
This camera is adorable and it was a great price.
My 10 year-old daughter loved this whole combo - the camera, the case, the film.
Very satisfied with product.
Ordered for my daughter for Christmas. Came in plenty of time. Camera  was exactly how advertised! Very nice camera and worked very well.
I got this as a gift for my 9yr old daughter. She loves it. To me the pictures look great remember it's a polaroid.
Awesome
I must've received a bad camera or film pack, because all my pictures are coming out way too dark, even if the picture was taken in broad daylight. Incredibly disappointed.
Great camera! My sister loved it.
DIG MY MINI 8
perfect size.
Cute little camera for a great price. It's definitely such a great experience being able to capture once-in-a-lifetime moments and being able to keep a physical copy instantly. The only con is that the pictures are on the small side, though they are still cute. They are perfectly wallet sized! Easy to use camera & easily portable, I love it!
We were satisfied , it made my daughter happy... I thought I was getting the instax for 59$ no shopping and I paid $71.04... Not sure what I was charged for.??
Very great camera for kids. Produces high quality photos!
Bought this for my 15 yr old. She loves it. It's easy to use. Pictures have a cool, vintagy look to them.
Pictures look great when indoors, not so great when outdoors. Have attempted to search the Internet to see find a fix or to see what I might of done wrong, but have yet to find a solution.
My granddaughter loved it!
Came right on time. I love this thing. Just remember to order film when you buy it. The best prices are on Amazon for film. Easy to use and great for parties.
Seems like a bit of a novelty item but my wife and I love it. The settings are easy to use, especially if you havent used a film camera since you were a preteen like me.
This is so fun to use
I bought this for my best friend and she absolutely loved this!! It came in perfect condition and brought 2 double a batteries thanks!
Amazing
Muy buena
It's a fun and cute little gadget! It's easy to learn but the pictures are a bit small. They are not as big as old Polaroid pictures; they're about half the size but they still have the same look. Haven't had a single problem with mine and it was here 2 days early!
Loved it!!
Bought for my 10 year old. She loves it and it does the job well.For my part, I thought it was expensive for a camera that only takes instant photos. It would have been better value if it also had the capability to take digital photos as well.  And we there is the expense of buying film as well.... which also is not cheap.  But apart from that, its lots of fun, looks great and seems well made.
Little small photos , could be a little bigger
Cute and amazing
I  bought this camera for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it !!!  Its fun and compact.  Great for fun pics and instant pics  Easy to use, you can produce high-quality, credit-card sized photos in an instant. The camera features a brightness adjustment dial that allows you to take pictures anytime, anywhere—indoors, Pictures come out great and in seconds. I'd recommend it for anyone trying to get a gift for any occasion.
I purchased this camera for my daughter's 5th birthday. She loves this camera.  Yes, the film is a little pricey but if used in moderation, it's worth the money.
fun camera
This is a great little camera. Both of my children have one and enjoy taking pictures
Spent about 40$ on film and the camera. I took about 12 photos and then suddenly it stopped working. I never dropped it and I've changed the batteries multiple times. Can't return it now.
I love love love this camera!! I wish the films were a little cheaper but these are rare items and it is so much fun with it. When asking people to help you take a photo, everyone gathers around for the final product, it is a great fun product for those that love photography.
I'm in love with mine!!
Love this camera.
My 15 year old daughter has so much fun with this ! She loves it. Film is a bit pricey, but worth it.
This product is amazing. It does what its suppose to do. Easy to us. I would recommend this for people who are looking for polaroid cameras. The beauty of this product is that it has "hi-key" which is one of their product updates.I love this product. But u have to make sure u use every shot wisely. Coz ones u press on it, its done. And remember that the "see through" hole is highwr than where the lens of the camera is. So i would adjust it a little bit higher. Adjust the setting, adjust the view, focus and ur good to go 👍🏻
I got mines yesterday! It is so much prettier in person. Everything looks good I'm just waiting for my film to come. I highly recommend it especially since I got it for $50.
My kids think this is the most amazing thing ever! They love seeing the photos come right out. Easy to use, even for kids.
LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera.  Bought it to be used as a way to have a party favor for a kids birthday.  They loved the pictures and a fun way to have a momento.
Love it! Got it for a party in May, been using it since I received it a week ago. Can't put it down.tip.... the picture turns out down and to the left of what you are aiming at.  So don't line up perfectly in the sight or you may miss the top part of the picture you're trying to take
Bought this for my girlfriend as a surprise. She has not stopped using it and I might consider buying one for myself
So cute, I really love it. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because I haven't gotten to play around with it too much but I've taken pictures and I love them. Definitely worth the money, great quality snapshots as well
Happy Happy
Just received this camera today. I purchased it for my daughter's birthday gift, and live it do far. We have taken 6 pictures so far and they came out great! They are very similar in quality to the pnes I remember as a kid with my mom's Polaroid. S uper easy to use even with rudimentary instruction manual.  so far no problems as some reviews state, we will see as time goes on. But for now, for a $50  instant camera , I would definitely recommend this!
Very fun little camera.  Just be careful not to toss it around too much as the plastic scratches easily and I can see how pieces may become loose if not taken care of properly.
Camera met all my expectations and then some.  Having lots of fun with camera.  Also purchased the bundle which included a carrying case and other items.
I love this camera so much!!! It's hard to take pictures on extreme sunny days but I'm getting better at it... It's super fun to have it on parties to take pictures with friends
Got this for my daughter. Boy does she love it! The pictures are much smaller than the Polaroids that I remember.  Would buy again, it's a great price.
Very good!
Ease to used very handy
Daughter really likes this.  Easy to use and takes responsibly good pictures.  Some fun accessories you can use too.
Not sure what is wrong- either my camera or the corresponding film packs are defective. My pictures develop roughly 20% of the time. I am using the camera correctly and do everything the same each time, only 5 pictures out of the 20+ I have taken have developed, the rest are black and now I've wasted over 1/2 my film. I don't think it is a problem with the shutter, and I use the correct flash setting each time. Super disappointed with the entire situation. :(
Got this gift for my 15 year old sister for Christmas.  She absolutely loves it and can't get enough of it.  The perfect gift for a teenage girl!
Its perfect
Good fun.
I love it! It's very cute! Originally $100 or more but got the same thing here in Amazon for less. Happy with my purchase :)
I have a new respect for those who take photos with instant cameras. It's not as easy as I thought it would be, but I love my new camera!
Just love this camera.  The color is so pretty.  I get a lot of compliments on this camera. Takes good pictures.
I love my new camera, it's so small and easy to use:) recommend it to any one that likes the outdoors and photography
Love this camera!!  Camera is easy to operate.  Picture quality is great for an instant camera.  The raspberry color looks pink in these images but is actually more of a red color.  Great gift for our daughter!
I adore my camara! Love it , it arrived on time and the pictures come out great worth every dollar
My daughter love it!! This was her birthday present. For the price we paid, the quality of the product is really good.
Wife and I love this little camera. Nostalgia in the old school instant photo. Clear pics. Fast. Small and compact. Love this camera.
This couldn't work better! I absolutely love the simplicity of this product, and the price. I work in an Assisted Living community, and bought this for an event. Resident's loved getting their pictures taken, and I had a blast doing it.The only thing I would change is that it can only take 10 pictures before changing film.
Amazing quality. I would definitely recommend you and your friends to buy this camera. It's exactly worth the price and it's exactly what you see on YouTube and in pictures. It's super cute and really easy to use if your looking for a gift to give to someone this would also be great for that too. I love photography and I really wanted to get a camera that was cute and affordable.... So I found Fujiflim and I was hooked my mom and dad bought me one not to long ago (February 25, 2016) and I honestly don't regret buying it. The only thing was that I didn't order film when I got mine and there wasn't any film in the stores so I had to order my on Amazon. Amazon is literally your Bestfriend when buying film and other cute accessories I hoped I helped and I really hope you enjoy your camera! ❤️
I love it!! I was so happy when I recieved it!!
Perfct idea for a gift.
I wish it came with a free package of film instead of just purchasing it
So fun! My daughter loves it. Film is pricey but worth the fun.
This is absolutely perfect for snapping pictures on the go to keep. The auto setting definitely needs to be fine tuned but you can just change your settings yourself to fix that problem. I've gone through 2 film packs so far and I've only had it a week.
This has got to be the best poloroid I have had since I was a little girl. Sometime the light does not swith but the setting changes even if the light doesnt move.
I love this camera! It's hard to take a good photo at first because of the light, but with practice I got some very nice photos.
The camera worked good. The only thing we saw different was the box was marked raspberry but the color was a little "orangier" color than the case color. Both were marked raspberry. But our granddaughter said it was ok. She liked it.
Great product, great timing!
Love it!
Terrible. Never worked from the minute we got it. Left it in a box till we were outside of the return window and now we're stuck.
Best investment I have ever made. No problems what so ever
I love it! I ordered same day shipping and it got here five hours later! It works so well and it's super fun to use!
The camera is very good, the pictures turn out very clear and beautiful. However, it's a shame that the film costs so much and is a very small amount, but otherwise it's a fun investment and is much more affordable than a professional camera.
This is a magical product!  I work at a school, so imagine whenI tell kids I'm going to take their picture and it magically appears!Crazy!  Fun!  Love the color! My boss just bought one after shesaw the beautiful pictures!
this is very good
5stars
Purchased this camera for our young granddaughter's birthday and she is absolutely thrilled with it! ... and so are we.  The camera is easy for her to use.  The quality of the photos is surprisingly crisp and clear.  It's a great way to introduce children to the creative side of photography.
I love this! It's so cute and it was easy to assemble and the pictures are really small and adorable! Sorry for the random flying photo in the picture i posted haha.
Pictures are very poor quality. Would not recommend
Absolutely love this product! It's light and easy to carry in a purse, even if you don't have the special case for it. It also has multiple settings, from indoor to cloudy to very sunny, and the flash works great. It's fairly easy to use and you can take 10 photos before having to switch to the next cartilage. Fun way to save those special moments!
Fast shipping everything is ok so i am happy
Perfect for my romantic vacation
I love it
The 6 yr. old loves her camera and used up all of the film immediately. The photos are a little small and the quality isn't the best, but it works for a child
don't hesitate to buy this camera, it's nostalgic! sure film is a bit pricey...but who said to take photos of every damn thing you see? be conservative and take photos that are actually significant. in other words don't waste your film on bullspit you can photograph with your phone.
Got this for my girlfriend (now fiancé) as one of her Christmas gifts. Easy to use and simple to replace film. The photos are rather small if you're comparing to the vintage "Polaroid" but fun and good quality  nonetheless. Camera also has different settings for different lighting environments which is a plus. Downside would be that replacement film is expensive.
Love the camera can't beat the price . Received camera in 2 days free shipping with Amazon prime I am a very satisfied with Amazon
super awesome! the camera itself is cute and the pictures are awesome quality for a polaroid!~
Came with a few scatches on some places of the camera.....still cute but would've better if it was in a good condition
Actually purchased this for my five year old daughter (moms a photographer) so she loves having a camera of her own, and it's easy enough for her to use, I just have to change the film out for her.
Love my new camera.
The photo setting is a little strange. If you're indoors, most likely your photos will be washed out because the flash is too bright. We read that you can counteract this by adding a little bit of scotch tape in front of the flash. That seems to have done the trick!
Super cool and fun. Expensive film is about the only downside.
Love it! Nephew loves to play with it. Great nostalgia product. It's nice to have an actual photo on hand. The film is a little expensive but worth it. Very easy to use even for a child.
Our dughter needed an instant camera for a school project and we found this one to be a great buy. Highly recommended...
I love it so much. I dont regret buying it at all. Its fun and easy to use and way cheaper here than at the stores.
Cutest thing ever! We love it! Great quality!
This product came on time and as shown. Works great and easy to use. Love it!
Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. I purchased this with the Mudder Retro Leather Case, and it worked out really well. Shipping was fast, too!
Great camera! Hard to figure out settings at first.
It surprisingly takes good pictures.  I bought the extra attachment for taking selfy which makes the camera looks even cuter. So far so good.. Very easy to use. The only downside is the bulkiness
Awesome and fun. Good for a little board and some old school photographing.
I love it!
OMG I LOVE THIISSSS. No issues, great quality, came in perfect condition. <3 I love this.
Everything came perfectly, thank you.
I love it. Still getting used to it and in order to get used to it you need to take many pictures which can be costly. If you dont mind spending money on the film than this is perfect.
My daughter loves this camera! Good quality!
I love this camera. The Polaroids are obviously smaller than the classic old school Polaroids, but I still love them !!
Bought it for my grand daughter. She loves it. It takes great pics
Excellent!!
Great Camera
great camera
Purchased this for my gf and she loves it! Pictures come out looking great
Absolutely love it. I've been taking many pictures with it in all kinds of different lighting and they come out great. Shipping was fast.
Arrived faster than I expected ! So in love
Love this camera. I was looking for a Polaroid camera a while ago thinking I was being originally in this day and age. Of course the second I get mine in the mail I start noticing everyone with the same camera. Either way it's cute, light, and takes good pictures.
good
I've done the setup correctly but the camera won't turn on
Great camera
Very good ,it even came before the dates assigned for it.
I just got me camera a few days ago. I was so happy with it but suddenly it broke! I mean it just fell off from the car seat to the car ground and that happened! I was looking for the warranty but funnily they don't cover "accidents" i mean if u don't cover this what will u guys cover! So disappointed.
Great camera, daughter loves it!
Bought as a gift for my cousin, and she loved it. Was exactly what she was looking for and i knew by the description that she was going to love it. Shipped very fast and didn't have any problems with it upon opening. Everything worked right out of the box.
great camera
I've wanted this camera for years and always told myself I didn't need it, well I decided I needed it, and I love it. The pictures come out great, it's so fun to take cute little photos of my friends and write the date on them so I can keep these memories close to my heart! And the pink color of the camera is just a bonus.
My granddaughter was very pleased with her present.
Absolutely love
Love it!
Happy happy happy!!!
Didnt include batteries like in the description
I'm very happy, it's exactly what I expected.
Great camera for keeping memories. Tested the camera with 2 film and one was used with a selfie lens. So far so good
I love it
In love!! This camara is awesome!! Takesgreat pictures is light in weight!! It's just perfect!!
Birthday gift for my niece, and she LOVES the camera. Fast shipping, and it arrived a few days before her birthday!
LOVE IT!!!! My only complaint is mine did not come with batteries so I had to buy my own. Besides that everything was perfect.
Great for exactly what I wanted, the old feel of a Polaroid for todays age.  It does look a little strange and feels a little strange in your hand, like a hamburger you're trying to grasp with mittens.  Great for parties though, the instant feel is great and is a wonderful momento.  In most dark places the flash gets the subject lit up quite well.
Sent it back. My step daughter complained it took bad pictures. Didnt work properly.
This camera is soooo amazing, I love it! The Polaroids are kinda small, but I dont mind. Well worth the price. The photos are of GREAT quality!
So much fun!  Vintage quality, instant Polaroid photos.  My creative 7 year old easily operates it, and her big sister, and mom, and dad, all want their own!  Highly recommend.
This camera won't print out my pictures correctly they're just white...
I got this camera for my daughter for her 14th birthday. She wanted this for Christmas but I was unable to get for her at the time. She is a picture kinda girl. She loves taking pictures of her self and her friends.This camera takes nice clear pictures. I am surprised at the quality of the pictures you get from this little camera. This is great for them that like to scrap book because there pictures are instance and you get great pictures. My daughter wanted the black one but you have other colors to choose from so you can pick the perfect color for you. This camera is small so it is easy to have on you for them camera moments. If you choose you can also get the case with the camera. This camera cost me $69.00 dollars which is worth every penny but now I see it for $49.00 so you should grab yours now. I think this is a perfect gift for teenagers.This product was purchase for normal pricing and this is my honest and unbiased review.
Love this camera! It is great for parties! Everyone always asks me where I got it at and wants a pic. The film is kinda expensive but worth it!
The qualitiy of the picture is not always the best
The ítem arrived just on time and it was perfect! I recomend the seller. On the other hand, I traveled to Europe a few days ago and the camera isn’t  too resistant to the cold weather. Photos took a long time to appear and the quality wasn’t the best. Even so, I love it!
got exactly what I ordered! personally wish that I had gotten a different colour as the colour in person looks slightly childish to me but I still like it! the pictures develop in about 5 minutes, and the instructions on how to take a picture or set up the camera weren't very clear but thanks to YouTube videos I figured it out. overall it is exactly what I bought and expected so very good!
Cute camera! Takes a few pics to get the hang of what settings to use but we have fun using it to snap pics!
This makez picture taking extra fun. Cool retro effect. The only negative I found is that you need plenty of light, or the photo is a little distorted.
This camera is so fun!!!  I bought it as a gift and plan on buying on for myself soon. I have used the one my sister has and think it is great for small parties and group events to be able to take pictures and have instant gratification. It is very easy to operate and film is pretty cheap and also easy to get. Its a novel fun toy and makes for a great gift too
The camera is amazing!!!! Very clear! The only thing I will say about this SELLER is that the attach a photo as if film is included. Besides that item came quickly and was exactly what I anticipated.
Love it- fast shipping, everything as posted :)
Love it!!!! Easy to use! So much fun!
Exactly as pictured , I was so scared of getting scammed and now I'm so happy I didn't !!! Yay can't wait for the film to come in the mail to use it !!
This Fuji camera is Amazing and worth every penny!!! Easy to use & Pictures come out phenomenal! Everyone in my family loves it!!
Love it!
I bought this for my 7 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it! She has so much fun taking pictures with it and watching them develop right before her eyes! I will say that it can be fragile. She accidentally dropped it in a carpeted area and the front part of the lens popped off.  Luckily, we were able to get it back on.  Even without it, it didn't really effect the function of the camera.
This camera is super simple to use. I love the retro look of it. It is perfect for a teenage girl that is all about selfies with her friends, but it could be perfect for many other people. I, personally, got it for work reasons to help thank people for referrals. I had previously been taking pictures with a  phone, emailing them to myself, downloading them to the computer, then to finally print them out, and cut them to size. This was a truly daunting task. Now, I can simply have the picture in a matter of minutes. The pictures are not great quality. Honestly, they have a vintage look to them. I do feel in this day and age that Fujifilm could have improved the clarity of the photos, which is the reason for the 4 stars. Otherwise this is great camera. I do think it has a slippery texture that could make it prone to dropping and the wrist strap is a must have. It doesn't come with film, unless stated, which is also kind of frustrating. I felt like they should at least add in a few for practice. Also, there is no way to store the pictures digitally. Maybe that will be a feature in future models.
Fun little camera.  Bought as gift.
Perfect camera nothing more to say
I did not get what I ordered this is the second time this happen, in the picture it showed you the one you are ordering and you expect it to look like that....  The one I got looks exactly like the one in the photo except the words on the corner of the camera. The one I got looks weird and cheap.
Love this Camera, the pictures are a little low quality, but that's kind of the point isn't it?
Ordered 3/11 and was delivered 3/12!!! Assembling was easy, clear instructions. Great picture quality and easy to handle. Cant wait to go on a trip!
Used this camera for a selfie station at our Halloween wedding. Absolutely so much fun. Loved the high quality pics our friends and family left for us!
I thought this camera was very cute so I picked this up for my girlfriend. I have the old model as well, but this new model is much better cause it comes with limited edition accessories. It comes with special Hello Kitty film that is only available with this camera, stickers, and a shoulder strap. It is still the same point and shoot camera that prints out the film instantaneously. On the lower back of the camera, a small circle displays the number of film you still have left to shoot. This new model comes with an extra mode thats perfect for selfies. My girlfriend loves the new one I got her and gave me her old one to use.PROS:- Limited edition accessories- Extremely cute and fashionable- New high-key mode (takes brighter pictures with a soft look)- Prints photos out instantaneouslyCONS:- NONEIf you get this 40th anniversary Hello Kitty model, I advise getting a case for further protection first and a film book. If you want your girlfriend to love you more, I definitely recommend you to get this for her. It's a very inexpensive present that brings joy to most girls.
Ordered for my 8yr old daughter and she loves it! Very neat, works great.
Super fun!
love it. the color is nice and easy to use
Awesome camera, purchased for my daughter's 5th birthday. Film is a little pricey.
Love and works perfectly.
I bought this for my teenage daughter for Christmas as a fun thing to have! It takes great little pictures that the kids love to trade right away! It really has been a fun thing to own!
Enjoy it very much
Loved it!! Oh my gosh it is so cute, works awesome, shipping was fast, and even though it was refurbished it worked good as new
This is the cutest camera...I bought for my 10 yr old granddaughter's birthday...after a little help from mom to get the settings just right..they had a ton of fun taking photos all throughout the sleeper over. ..much giggling did the photos generate.. fun fun fun
I love this camera ! i bought this for my daughter and she loves taking pictures with it , plus it is so vintage. The only drawback is that you have to constantly buy film and they cost about $20-$36 . We are going to South Padre Island for spring great and this is the perfect thing to take with you , its not as heavy as a professional camera but it has the same quality as a professional camera !
I was a little bit confused about the brightness dial setting but after reading the manual, figured out that the setting is adjusted automatically. You can choose to put the dial at the darker setting to get a softer picture. Easy to use! Can't wait to use it during my travels.
I recently bought this camera, and used it for the first time yesterday. However, the first three pictures I took did not develop right. It develops a little but for the most part the picture is white. I wanted to know if I could get a different one.
Took this to Cuba to hand out picture's, a huge success!
This was a birthday gift for my Granddaughter . She was excited to get it and said all the kids are using them. I haven't seen a picture taken yet , but it sure made her happy getting this camera .
I got this for a gift, she loves it!
I purchased this camera for my trip to Hawaii. The first day I used it.. It worked great. I was able to take photos inside and outside. The second day I used it, it began to not take photo... It would take the picture but not print the image... Wasted several sheets of photo paper. I tried to adjust the fail to change the setting to inside and outside.. There are 5 setting choices. The fail would not work.. The red light would blink to all the choices than get stuck on inside setting. Will you can not take pictures outside on that setting so you waste a lot of film. With that said.. Once you get setting set the pictures are great!
I love it
Came in great condition I recommend to everyone
love it
Awesome and fun camera to use! Love the instant pictures. I love this color as well,  it's a pastel yellow. I just use the different instructions and tricks on youtube from diff vloggers. Great buy! Best price I've seen so far, glad I made this purchase.
No problems went well
Just as pictured and fast shipping.
This camera is so cool and cute! its little and the picture quality of the Polaroids are surprisingly really clear. Defiantly a good buy
I didn't think much of it at the$$ but daughter loved it
I love it so much. The only thing is that when you center it it goes to the right a bit
Love love love! Still trying to get used to the flash settings, but other than that it an amazing little camera!
Purchased for my 10 year old for Christmas. She loves it. Having instant pictures is great! They are small so they don't take up a lot of space.
OMG THIS CAMERA IS THE BEST THING GOING FOR FUN INSTANT PRINT AT YOUR FINGER TIPS AM OLDER THEN THE NORMAL TEEN AM AN ADULT AN WE HAVE SO MUCH FUN I KNOW THAT THE SD CARDS FOR CAMERAS HAVE TAKING OVER OF COURSE CAUSE TIME MOVES ON BUT IT GREAT TO SEE A COMPANY BRING BACK SOMETHING OLD BUT TO MAKE IT A LITTLE NEWER TO KEEP YOU IN THE LOOP, HONESTLY I USE THIS MORE THAN MY SD CARD CAMERA FOR I GET MY PICTURE INSTANT JUST LIKE THE OLD POLIROID CAMERA BACK IN THE DAY BUT WITH A MORE SWIFTIER LOOK AN STYLE PLUS IT COMES IN MANY COLORS I WOULD ALWAYS HAVE BE AN OWNER OF ONE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS BUT YOU LIKE KEEPING UP TO DATE WITH THE SD CAMERAS THEN AT LEAST GET IT FOR YOUR KIDS OR GRANDKIDS FOR THERE FIRST CAMERA I BOUGHT THE GROOVY CASE AN XTRA FILM FOR IT AN ILOVE IT
It was great
Worth the price!
Camera arrived very fast and in perfect condition. I love it already I can't wait to use it. Perfect size for traveling
This camera is fantastic!Originally, I got this camera because my friend bought one in Korea, in a pastel yellow. It's light weight, and completely easy to use. All you do is put in the AA batteries, a film pack, and voila! You're ready to use the camera. It has settings, "in doors," "cloudy," "sunny," "very sunny," and "hi-key." The wrist strap is also a nice addition, because I drop things very easily.
I recently took a trip to the Grand Canyon and Red Rock, I brought this camera along to capture the beauty of both places on film. All of my pictures turned out spectacular aside from a select few, (however, that is my fault - the place I was taking a picture was a bit too dark, so make sure there is enough brightness available for the picture). This was definitely a rewarding buy.
Awesome! Exactly what I expected:)
Very fun camera to have ! Friends got a big kick out of it when they could see the pics right away. Just like the 70's camera but the pictures come out a bit smaller but very clear.
Camera is so cute! Easy to use and produces fantastic pictures. SO excited to take it everywhere.
Love this camera and the color! I got it because it was slightly cheaper and fell in love with the color!! Definitely recommend
Great camera for kids.
This was a gift. I was hoping they had put a sample film with it.
I love this little camera but I wouldn't suggest for people 18+. It's really fun at first but then it's just another thing lying around. I got one for my 8 year old sister though. She definitely took more interest in it longer than I did.
Fun stuff, my 11 year old loved it, it was a gift.  Her dad and I took turns using it as well, it was great! Thanks for the fun!
It is great it came quickly, brand new, just like what you would buy in a store except cheaper it is such a beautiful color. I am so happy! Thank you guys so much for it :)!!1
love it
Easy to use instant camera, although the resolution of the picture is not as I was hoping I'd still buy it again, maybe as a gift
love it
awesome camera my daughter loves it
I bought this camera for my niece for christmas she LOVED it! the quality of the pictures is amazing its was a great choice
My daughter Loves This!!
Its adorable, the color is more red than raspberry. Other than that it amazing and my daughter loves it.
I love it.
I purchased one of these for my grandson's Christmas present and had to purchase another for my granddaughters 6th birthday.  As you would guess, the film doesn't last too long, but the children love it!
I got this as a gift for my girlfriend. She absolutely loved it! We couldn't stop taking pictures of each other! The quality of the photos is awesome considering its a mini Polaroid. Definitely satisfied and I recommend to any and everyone!
Great Buy! So much fun!
No idea why yellow was the cheapest but okay.Works great, very simple and easy to use for casual point and shoot. Not trying to earn millions of instagram virtual dollars with this.
To date, I've purchased five of these cameras as gifts, for work, and for personal use, and they never fail to bring a smile to anyone's face. It's small enough to stuff into a mid-sized purse, and the variety of settings are handy, too. I bring my Instax camera everywhere, and have posted the photos on our wall and also strung them together on twine with glittery clothespins. I've had my Instax for two years now and haven't ever encountered any trouble with it, and it's had its fair share of falls and drops! Highly recommended.
I don't understand why these are so popular in the age of super sharp cell phone photos.  However,  my daughter loves it and is having fun with it.
I really missed my old instant camera ,so I got this one and some film delivered  and wow , this is so much fun . the camera is light and smaller than I thought but the color was definitely more coral not raspberry . its easy to use and came with wrist strap and batteries instructions in all languages . it was so fun to show my Grand kids what this thing did , they just looked as that picture develop and were so amazed .Best thing to see
Very cool camera. Easy to operate, we really enjoy it. And the price was very reasonable. Keep up the good work Fuji!😊😊😊👍🏻
It took a little bit to get used to it, in order for the pictures to come out great, but after that it's great!
It takes great pictures just small but plain
I LOVE my fujifilm instax mini, so much fun to use and the quality of pictures are great.
Great camera to get someone as a gift!
Pleasant surprise-serves the purpose.
She loves this so much!  Fun to see kids love something they actually have to wait for!  Reminds me of the old Polariods of my childhood!
Such a fun and cute camera but buyer beware...If you are a person who is use to digital, its nothing like it. It seems like common sense but its a bit of a shock to realize they're not coming out like your cell phone images. I grew up with 35mm and polaroids and I have to readjust my way of taking pix but if you have never been raised that way, my guess is... it will irritate you. The viewfinder isn't directly through the lens, so your pix will be off set a little then what you aimed for and the pix are darker and nothing like the brightness of what your use to, so you have to practice with distance and the flash. I practically wasted a whole package of film to get reacquainted with the way old school photo taking was. I think its a great road trip, being goofy in the car and with friends kinda camera and also great for a little kid that doesn't really care how their images turn out, just excited that it's instant.  Im glad I purchased it and would buy it again. Its a simple camera that takes me back to simple times and just having fun.
nice!
My daughter loves this ! Very happy with her gift.
I ordered this camera on a sunday and arrived at my house on a monday in which i am very pleased with the shipping (I have Amazon Prime). The camera came in the original real packaging. The product comes with batteries for camera, a strap, and of course the camera its self. Im very happy with product everything has worked just fine and I've had no problems at all! I do recommend this product to anyone with no doubt!
Granddaughter loves it
Awesome!!
This is awesome totally love it #socute need film tho ;( that's ok I'll just get it from Amazon #bestplacetoshop love my new instax mini ahhhh
I bought 2 of these for my twin 11 year old daughters.  They took pictures all over the place!  The photos are small, but the girls expected that.  No disappointment with this version of an old Polaroid.
love
Such an awesome little camera! Great for scrapbooks and tiny memories!
love it <3 <3
liked it
Love the camera - especially the cute light yellow color. The Pictures are a little small but turn out nicely. I brought this to a party and it was a hit! The size is perfect - fits well in a medium size handbag so very portable. Ended up buying a different color as a gift and they loved it. Would recommend if interested in buying a Polaroid camera 😄
I bought my camera and on the beggining it works very weel. When it arrives I had a lot of fun with my friends, and the pictures was awesome. But, after 1 month I started to see that the quality was not the same, I thought that was the light in that day. 2 weeks later I traveled, and when we took the first picture, the photograph did not leaves the camera. We took again and it leaves, but with some white stains. Now, it happens all the time and I am not using anymore. I did not recommend, was the worst disappointment I ever had with something that I bought.And I could not return, because was more the 1 month, and the seller do not have a contact.
Absolutely love it ! Came in perfect condition and was worth every penny.
Such a good camera! I love how you can change the lighting and the prints are just the right size. I love my camera soooo much!!!!
Ok, it's a total splurge buy, but totally worth it!  We love it. The teens love it. Everyone at the restaurants we go to and take family pics love it!  Super cute camera. It takes several practice shots to figure out the exposure/flash options. But overall, you get the same 'easily out of focus', 'over exposed' Polaroid pictures we all grew up with!! LOVE!! It was really fun watching my 13 yo take a picture, see it "pop out" and then develop infrintbif her. Worth every penny!!
I love it it's so cute!
Picture in seconds and it gives it that retro old look. Love it and def worth the price. Its much cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else. Great buy!
My daughter loves this camera. She takes a picture of everyone that comes over. Easy to operate and takes nice little pictures.
My order came in before the expected date:D I'm obsessed with my camera will buy again I highly recommend it! The color is a bit darker but still cute!
I love taking this traveling. When I come across children in small villages or remote areas, they love to get their photos taken and it is a great alternative to giving them candy. It has been with me to the Mongolian Steppe, Romanian Orphanages, Peruvian mountains...
Love this camera!!  The pictures turn out nicely and the camera is easy to use.  I gave this to my daughter for her 6th birthday and she loved it.  She used it at her party and all her friends now want one too.  It takes nice pictures and the film with the decorated borders on it is really fun.
I adore this camera, the picture style reminds of me of the old school polaroids and they're so much more meaningful since they are an actual physical photo instead of a digital one. The one tip is to try to shoot pictures in decent lighting and not too far away from your subject, because the picture can come out too dark even if you have the camera on the right setting.
It's amazing and just how it should be. I love it!!
Great camera! Takes good pictures and if super fun and easy to use!
Love this!! The pictures obviously are regular sized Polaroids but for $60 bucks the mini is so worth it!!
This camera is the cutest and most fun in photography I've ever had.
It was purchased as a gift and was exactly want was wanted. Great surprise.
She loves it
happy with the camera
Bought in 2015, worked great for my wedding guest book, would buy again.
Oh my God! I am in love with this camera. I got a clear cover for it just to be super careful with my little love. But honestly, if you're looking for a professionally photographed picture then it's definitely a no-no. But for all those vintage things obsessed people you have come to the right place, don't think twice before ordering it. Just need to be careful while taking pictures, as I have previously mentioned don't expect super perfect and clear pictures, but it's best while creating those special memories in picture instantly. You have a memory of your best time, without fearing to have lost it due to accidentally deleting your pictures on your phone, or in worst case scenarios if your phone gets lost. Sometimes, few memories are a lot worth then few dollars and for such time your Fujifilm Instax mini 8 is perfect.It's Fujifilm, it's a reputed and well-known brand so definitely there's no chance anything going wrong with the camera. Just keep the obvious things in your mind don't drop it in the water, don't drop it, and don't cover the flash while taking pictures.PS. Your friends are gonna be so jelly ;)
Love love love!
Nice color, and great camera.  Bought the twin pack film to accompany a terrific gift!
just GREAT!!!Camera works perfectly and simply love it.
Looks good, and works great!
My kids loved it! A lot of fun.
It broke within a few uses. Totally doesn't work at all. A waste of money. My 14 yo birthday present.
Great camera
a gift for grand kids they went nuts with thus camera. love it
Bought this for my daughter's graduation party and it worked great!Perfect little size and they like that the pics spit out right away and they can watch them appear.Great for a party.
It works fine, I don't have any problems with it, and I've had it for about 2 months now.
It's a fun camera
A fun camera. Made very well great gift.
Easy to use
Wonderful and receive in a timely manner.
<3 thank you
Just perfect
Love this camera. The photos are so fun, and it's great to have at parties. I only rated it 4 stars and not 5 because I wish the film was more affordable.
Good one, if it had gift wrap option it would be perfect
Great for fun. Really easy use and super cute!
Got it for my daughter.  She loves it and it works great.
Love it!
Niece loved it!
Easy to use and takes good pictures for a polarized camera and gives a nice retro feel
Great gift for tween
I am not a professional photographer, just an ordinary person that loves playing with the camera. You need to learn to use the different options like outside, inside, etc and then the pics look great.
Boyfriend loved it!!!!
It's awesome
Light, compact instant photos that are good quality.
Llooooove it
What a great gift for anyone! There is nothing better then a Polaroid!
The camera appeared to be in good condition at first, but when I tried taking a picture, the flash didn't work and they came out blank.
I got the grape color and love it! It's a dark purple and looks great with pretty much anything. Love the vintage look of the prints! Before I left a 1 star review for the raspberry color because it was tremendously ugly, instead of red it was a faded, old looking orange. This one that I have now works and looks amazing!The good: The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 is a cute, easy to use compact device. It can easily fit into a handbag and isn’t cumbersome to hold but I got one of the cute and convenient cases (that did not come with the device) that has a strap for around the body to protect my baby girl. The camera didn't come with a selfie mirror so I highly recommend getting one, if you're thinking of taking selfies with it (they're fairly inexpensive) just so you know where to position yourself. The operations are minimal, since the device is almost fully automatic, if and when you rotate the dial the light doesn't move that is why, it determines the best setting for the amount of light that surrounds the subject. It uses double A batteries (which came with the device) that are easy to find! Instant gratification!The bad: It holds only 10 film sheets at a time. The film it's expensive. Have to get batteries for the device when they run out. Sometimes the pictures aren't as clear as you want them to be. Didn't come with clear instructions, had to look for them on the Internet. The box it comes in seemed old and faded.Overall I love my little camera so I say get it! You won't regret it!
Not much quality for price!
Not sure why these are so popular with the 11-14 yo gang.... Especially the girls, but when did adults ever understand kids.
Have a blast every time I use this camera. Who doesnt love polaroids
The color is more like a red orange...something like that, but came in soon, very well packaged it just wasn't the color that i wanted.
Small pictures but it's super cute and fun happy I bought this
Bought this for my 14 year old as a Christmas gift. She LOVES it!!
Great, fun gift for tween or teen.
I really like this camera everyone should have one to make great memories :)
My daughter just tried it for the first time, it doesn't work and now I see it is unreturnable
it' all in chinese even the warranty card saying it's only for china....have to return it.
I take this pretty little thing everywhere!
Absolutely love my new Instax mini8! Taking night time photos can be a challenge but overall it's awesome!
Perfect size! I bring this with me everywhere I go. Super cute and just perfect!
This camera was a gift for my wife.  She had a friend who payed a lot more for this item on another site and didn't have a selection on color.  The camera takes good pictures and with the 7 in 1 kit available, you can take great instant selfies as wel as other neat filters and a fitted case to protect the camera.  This is good for scrapbooking as you might imagine.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for fun instant camera.
I got this for my daughter for Christmas. Bought it as a package or so I thought no film came with it very disappointed she couldn't use it for weeks until I got the phone in the mail. Film extremely expensive
Loveee
Great quality (vintage looking) photos & easy to set up and use. The film makes it quite expensive, but I don't plan to use it too often! Only problem I encountered was that all of the directions were not provided I n English. Luckily it was easy to figure out using the diagrams & common sense!
I purchased this as a gift for my niece and she loved  it.I have not seen the camera so going by what she told me. She said it was exactly what she wanted and was easy to operate.
Great ! I love it
My daughter loves it.
Great product but all instructions were in Chinese.
daughter loves it
I love it! It works good and mine did have the selfie mirror on it. My friends and I all enjoy it, I'm very glad I bought this.
We bought this as a Christmas gift for our 10 year old. She LOVE it and was happy with the color.
Works wonderful!
I had purchased this camera for my daughter whom is currently a junior in college.  She LOVES the color, and the pictures that it takes.  Brings it with her to parties, friend events, etc..  Don't get plain black if getting for your kid.  They have quite a few vibrant colors.
I love the way the camera looks especially since it looks like a toy but i dont like the way the pictures come out especially since they're so small.
Works perfect, was nicely shipped, takes great pictures. I am really please and going really enjoy this for my kids birthday partys.
This thing is great. GF loves it and won't stop using it. No issues at all.If your into taking photos, traveler, blogger, parents, crafter whatever you NEED to have one of these around. Well worth it.I would like to see them make one that prints larger photos (these are about the size of a credit card) but still 5 stars period. Thank you'
my 11 yr old daughter loves her camera
My daughter asked for this for Christmas but we waited and got a much better price.  She loves it.  The color is perfect.  Just as pictured.  One word of caution - it doesn't come with film :-(.
This camera is advertised as having a mirror but I order it TWICE and it is not the same product, doesn't come with a mirror. FALSE ADVERTISING do not order from here.
Tips for Taking Photos with Instax Mini!1. take good care of the camera i.e it shouldn’t be jostled or dropped because THE LENS circle thing WILL FALL OFF. You can stick it back on but there’s always a little risk involved, the first time the lens fell off I nearly got a heart attack.2. never, ever take a photo in sucky lighting (ex. Our house which is lighted purely by incandescent lamps) In fact limit indoor photos unless it’s an extremely special/candid moment that can’t be replaced. Don’t lie to yourself and think “it’ll turn out good anyway” Nuh uh3. Always pay attention to the dial and turn it. I’ve had photos come out as yellowish blanks because someone forgot to turn the dial4. do not play around with the dial and think you can judge what setting is best for the weather…the camera really is most accurate.5. Try to wear light colored clothing. Not white because the flash will react badly. Not dark/black clothing because the background of the picture (ESPECIALLY if indoors) darkens naturally and you can “Fade” into the background.6. Selfies are always best with natural light. If not, and you’re taking a selfie with a friend, remember that the person holding the camera (and therefore closest to it) is more likely to get a little bit whited out (not a lot, but a little) than the other person.7. The lens can hold a surprising amount of space/number of people in one photo. This means that if for example, you’re taking a photo of a big group of people, you don’t have to back up as much as you think. If you do their faces will have less focus. Don’t be afraid to close up a little bit. (referring here to horizontal photos of course)8. The camera can take very nice photos both vertically and horizontally. Vertically is better for portraits and closeups and is very flexible. Horizontal, however, can get you a beautiful “slice of life” feel, when you want to focus not only on the people but the background and scenery.9. The paper/material the photo is printed on is thick, white, and has a little space under the photo itself for you to write something. ALWAYS write with a thin pen Sharpie. Normal pens, ballpens, ink pens whatever bleed and smudge and look plain nasty.So maybe now you’re wondering….wow, this camera has a lot of limitations. Should I seriously get it?? And my answer….YES! Yes you should. The photos just feel so incredibly real. It’s like holding that moment in your hand. It’s so different from digital photos or even printing at Walgreens. You can look at a photo over and over again, and every time notice something good and different. It’s hard to explain, but these photos are so old timey and vivid, every one of these is like a breath of fresh air. And another thing…EVERYONE loves instant cameras….I met my cousins for the first time this winter, and I honestly feel like we really bonded over this. Every time you take a new photo, everybody hovering around like “how’d it turn out??” and you get to watch it develop (extremely interesting.) It only takes a minute for the photo to develop, but a few more for the colors to really pop.So yes….Get it. Make sure to watch a couple YouTube tips/reviews/demo vids and be sparing with the pictures, they ARE pricey!!
Awesome
i love it but i wish i bought it around this time because i got mine for 80 bucks. to be exact 82.95
I got the camera the next day and I absolutely love it!
I love the camera and I use it quite often, yet mine was off-centered. Im not sure if this is common with all of these but my friend and I both bought one from the same person and they both seemed to be off centered when the photo was taken.
I love the camera. The film is definitely affordable and the quality is great.
This camera is $110 at the store I got the same camera and the case for less than that! I love it the color is perfect. The case is really good quality.
Bought this for my daughter and she loves it! It was the perfect gift. Great picture quality also!
No selfie timer. High exposure every time. Gifted to a friend and purchased the next model up which cured these issues.
Works and my niece loves it!
Arrived on time and was packaged nicely. My sister LOVED this gift. It's what she's been wanting for a year now so she really enjoyed it. She was a little confused with the instructions but once she got it, she was able to make it work.
On time, and is so cute!
I love this camera so much! I've read it's kinda marketed for tweens and as a twenty something  heading to thirty, I have to say that adults can have just as much fun with it. I took pictures of all the kids at Christmas and gave them to the parents and they loved it. The camera works great and is easy to use. Yeah, your tween will love it, but so will you.
don't buy
My daughter gives this five stars!  She's had it for months and gets a lot of use out of it. Unfortunately the film is not cheaper.  From a parent's perspective, the quality of the photos are not good but kids love it anyway.  Worth the purchase if the kids love it.
My daughter loves her camera and uses it every time she's at her friends. If you want to make your kid happy then get it!!!
I bought this for my Fiancé and he loved it. He has a love for photography and with the little pictures that he's taken are his most important ones that he'll keep forever. We've taken pictures at night and in the day, they aren't HD pictures but they are Polaroids so they are clear enough to be scrapbooked or put in the refrigerator. I love this Polaroid, and want to get one for myself(one day)!
Excellent
Works great and super fast shipping!
Just got mine. Tested it out & the film comes up blank.
Love it
LOVE this camera. It's so easy to use, and so adorable!
Perfect for tweens.  My 11 year old daughter loves it - she got it for Christmas.  Fun for her to take picture with her friends.
Very Happy!
This camera is so adorable! The shipping was faster than anticipated, and I am so excited to use this on my upcoming trip. Perfect size camera to fit into a small bag
I LIKE TI SO MUCH
My 10 year old loves it. Takes photos and gives them away to friends. Happy girl.
My granddaughter asked for this for her 13th birthday. I was not aware that instant cameras were making a come-back. I remember the Swinger from Polaroid and was a little hesitant but the picture quality did not disappoint. He daddy is a professional photographer and he okayed the purchase and was pleased. Great for a 13 year old.
Love this instax mini 8....
My Girlfriend loves it.
My 9 year old daughter absolutely loves this camera.  I got it for her birthday and let her open it before her party because I knew she would want to use it.  Her friends were crazy about it too, and all wanted to know where they could get one.  They adored the small instant "Polaroid" type photographs, and were all sent home with a couple.  I had to police the situation because they were nearly fighting over them....I took that as a sure sign they liked them.  The camera is extremely easy to operate, and fun to use.  The pastel colors are great for young ladies.My only caution with this camera is that the film is rather expensive, and it's quite easy to just keep "clicking" with it.Remember, just like the original instant cameras,you must take one "photograph" before the film is ready to use. I made this mistake twice with a new film cartridge in....try getting a dozen 9 year olds to hold their pose again!Overall, this camera is so fun and functional, I had to give it five stars.  Although we have e not owned it for a long time yet, it seems sturdy and very well built. Even though it's plastic, it dies have some "heft" to it.Just so you are prior to purchase, this camera does not print regular "polaroid" size pictures. They are "mini" versions, but they are still very cool and the kids live them.Also be aware this does not take, or keep a digital version of you photograph.  It works just like and older instant camera; Once it prints the picture, it is gone from the camera forever.As long as you are aware of the price of film ahead of time, and do not have a problem with that; then I recommend this camera without reservation.
Have been wanting this item for a while now and decided to go ahead and purchase it. it was the best investment i could have made i love this camera and the pictures are actually very clear for such a small instant camera.
Amazing!!! Take it everywhere! Perfect modern Polaroid ❤️
Love this camera!
Dope
Love it
The idea for this camera is fun and retro but the pictures do not have good quality. I tested it out in several different lighting and areas but it cannot capture the scenery at all and most of the pictures turned out very over exposed. I returned this item for a refund.
So happy to have an instant camera in my life again. pretty inexpensive and so easy to use. i would definitely suggest buying a wholesale pack of film with it so you don't have to worry too much about wasting film as you try it out. the camera itself does not take photos well up close which can be slightly frustrating if you wanted to capture details as things tend to get washed out but thats not too much of a big deal for me as i knew what to expect.
I love this camera, but the colors are different than on the picture on the pink, the image need some improvement.
Love it !!!
So far, so good!
Great item decided to order another one but different color. :)
Picture size is rather small but the camera feels like a quality item and it is attractive.
works great!!! my daughter loves it...
Purchased this for my 11 yr old daughter for Christmas and she thinks its pretty neat. As adult remembering the old Polaroids, I just love it and will be getting one for myself soon.
Excelente
My daughter loves her camera. As a Dad though I don't think the picture quality is that great. She is 14 and takes lots of pictures. Film is quite pricey too...
gives nice picture ,sturdy
I had a Polaroid camera when I was little so naturally I wanted another instant camera! This one is so great & not to large! I love it & it makes events so fun!
Best product I ever purchased
My daughter loves this
this was a gift for our granddaughter  - and she LOVES LOVES LOVES it!  Huge hit with her and her friends at her sleep over.
This is a perfect little instant camera.  I will be creating my own photo booth at my wedding reception next month and these are perfect for my little wedding party to have fun with.
The film is expensive!!But if you're looking to take Polaroid photos this is a great tool to satisfy your craving.
Arrived on time and on good conditions, very good quality..Thanks
This was a gift for my grand daughter and she loved it.  Worked perfectly for her birthday sleep over party.
LOVED IT
I love my camera!  The pictures show in great quality and it's super cute and fun to use!
Love this camera simple and easy to use brings back nostalgia of when I was young and my parents had a camera like this
Bought this for a friend of mine. She hasn't said anything bad about it, so the instant camera most be great. Well packaged!
Love this camera!!
Absolutely love these products! Took them on a trip to Portland and had so much fun with the filters. The camera is super easy to use and all the fun attachments are great.
Great bargain at almost 1/2 the price of the cost in a retail store. My daughter loves this camera i gave her as a 17 b'day gift.
For my 14 year old. It's awesome. It's a freaking Polaroid but pics are smaller and film is .50/sheet. she LOVES it btw so who cares about moms opinion. It's on trend, fun, instant gratification, simple.
what a great way for instant pictures
I thought its included 1 pack of film? Im exciting to use it when I received my package just camera. because in the picture camera and one pack of film. Where is the film?
Gave this camera to my grand daughter for her 13th Birthday. She loves it!
Awesome
I ordered this on Saturday night I believe, it arrived yesterday on Wednesday, on time. It arrived without the batteries, which is why I haven't four stars instead of five. It wasn't super inconvenient, I mean it's not hard to get batteries. The picture quality is good, and as expected. Usually if you take a picture in your house, the background of the picture isn't pretty dark. The flash can be a bit much. Sometimes so I usually put the setting on sunny if I'm already happy withheld gusting for the most part. I bought a 50 pack of film, if you do it that way it's a lot cheaper. I also bought a (fake) leather case and a selfie lens to go with it. The view finder for the camera is a little off so leave room for there to be a slight mistake in positioning. I am pretty happy with this purchase, it would be a cute gift for a young adult in high school who is making a lot of memories or if you are going on a trip somewhere. It's just nice to have. I recommend it.
Love it!
I like this camera for my stepdaughter, however I bought it because the picture looked more pink than red. I got it yesterday and it's definitely a very deep coral and not as light pink as the picture... Should have gotten the purple. But I already wrapped it for her birthday.
Amazing!love this camera! Only thing I don't like is that you have to keep buying film,but film is cheap! Love it! Totally recommend this
Came in time and no complaints!
I receive the camera in prefect conditions. I was looking for a Polaroid camera with a great prices. This was the cheapest one I found and I am super happy with it. I absolutely love it!!
Best camera ever! Prints the cutest little pictures and fun to play with! Love poloroids
Absolutely do not buy!!! I received the camera, followed the instructions and tried shooting with it only to see that the film gets jammed. It wouldn't work no matter what and I wasted a whole thing of film. Terrible packaging and the wristband is not even the one that goes with the camera. The back door is even a different color. I'm very pissed overall, save yourself from a hassle and buy from a craft store
This is our 2nd camera. We used it at my daughter's photo booth so we didn't have to pay $300+ on one! Worked great. First pic is always a test pic. Very happy with product. Only drawback is film is pricey, unless you buy multipacks. We bought 2 multi 6packs for $75 total! 120 pics worked great for our photo booth. Also wish it took larger size film, like original Poloroid cameras, but it does a good job. Great for on the go and fun for a teenager/young adult for a night out. Better shots are taken when taken up close, otherwise quality is compromised. It's definitely a gadget for fun, If you are more seasoned photographer/hobbyist, like myself, you may be disappointed.
Great item!!
This camera is so awesome!! I love it!  It seemed cheap because its made out of plastic which I was worried about at first but after carrying it around with me for 5 days in a row it is still in perfect condition.  The pictures are so cool and vintage.  Its like a little present every time you take a photo.
The quality of the photos when taken outside is crappy, but it's great for indoor pictures
Works great and is SUPER FUN!
I love it!
Love this vintage camera
Super-fun camera.  Very easy to use.  Good quality.
Great camera
LOVE!
I bought this camera for my wife for her birthday and there is a settings nob for bright environment, shady, etc... Which didn't work, so I returned it and ordered a replacement. Then the replacement had the same problem.
Love it
It is awesome!!!Totally met my expectations!
Love it
Love it! Super cute and easy to use.
My daughter loved it a lot. She takes it to her school and takes picture with her friends. The pictures come out so cute. The camera is so pretty.
What a fun, nostalgic camera.  I guess these are very popular with the kids right now because my daughter's friends all love these too.  The Amazon price was much better than other places I've seen.
Really great and fun camera to use
I love this camera so much, I have taken nearly 20 photos since new years. Can be taken in any setting, since it has a quality flash. Just be careful before you snap a photo that it's on the correct setting, it will automatically be on house setting, but there are many options for the setting of the picture being taken. When you go to buy film buy it in bulk, much cheaper that way.
It should come with film. Major bummer.
This was just what our 16 yr. old grand daughter wanted, & she loves it.  Who knew today's kids would want a camera with film?
Description stated that batteries are included but they were not included when received.
Doesn't come with film.... just FYI! Don't make the same mistake we did! We took it to our friend's 30th birthday party and when she opened it and we went to put it together, no film :( Should come with at least a 10 pack in my opinion or clearer writing that it doesn't come with the film.
happy birthday daughter
Cutest thing ever!
The girls really enjoyed this camera and we found it to be easy to use.  Thanks!
It's came so quickly with Amazon Prime. Brand New so cute!!! And works! First camera I've ever had
The camera is great. Note, this specific one DOES NOT come with a pack of film, which I did not notice when ordering it.
Girlfriend loves it. It's cute and dainty and it still has the novelty.
I was never able to use the fujifilm! It never worked!! Such disappointment and waste of my money!
Bought it for my 12 yr old daughter .. And i WANT ONE NOW!!!!!
It's awesome :)
this came in excellent condition and my daughter is having a lot of fun using it.
Bought this as a Christmas gift for our daughter. It seems to take nice quality photos, but nothing that will blow your socks off. She loves it though, so it was worth the price.
Pictures don't turn out, horrible, waste of money
Its so cute I love it <3
Over all works good!! I love it, and really enjoy taking polaroids!!! The only prpblem, is the settings DO NOT change. So i cannot take cute photos at the beach in the sun:(  they just come out white. i heard people return theirs but i didnt wanna go through all that. It sucks. But over all i like this camera .
my niece was happy
My wife loves the camera. So far she is having a lot of fun with it. The seller shipped it right away and it arrived in a few days unscathed and in brand new condition.The only bad thing is that this camera is definitely NOT PINK. It is a weird shade of orange. We were going to send it back but my wife was too excited to play with it and decided to just settle and live with the off color. Hopefully there is a case or something I can buy for her.
This was a gift and she loved it!
Love this! the first picture I took was beautiful and I couldn't believe how every picture turns out really well. I usually don't get excited enough about something to write a good review but this is definitely worth it. I love it I love it I love it.
Cool little gift, lots of fun for the money.
Grand daughter loved the camera, uses it all the time.
Super cute! Perfect for taking pictures of special memories
It was a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loved it! It arrived quickly and was everything we hoped it would be.
I cannot wait to take this everywhere with me. I got a carrying case separately. My camera, sadly, did not come with the wrist strap! I took a picture of my plant... enjoy.
The camera came exactly as I expected, no surprises. It even came a day early! Great quality product, with the only downside that I can't take more than 10 photos per film cartridge. But there are so many bulk offers of film available online, even that isn't too disappointing. I highly recommend this product. Get snap-happy, my friends!
Love it!! It's nice and light. I did the faster shipping took two days. Ordered on Febuary 11,2016 and it got her Febuary 13, 2016 ans a little before 11:00 Am. So I really love it. It came with everything cause u ordered the camera accessories too so it was faboulus. I feel very kawaii!
Love it
I  gave this to my 8-year-old granddaughter for Christmas, and she loved it! She was visiting from out of town, recorded all her activities while she was with us, then went home with visual memories of her visit.
Great camera, awesome idea for a gift.
My teenager love  this camera and the instant pictures
No idea why the kids have drifted back to this style, but the film is insanely high priced, no use without the film, IMO if this had digital option, I would say sure, but this was a gift for a niece who really wanted it, so can't complain, just scratching my head as to why they would want them
This is a perfect gift, my daughter love it...
My daughter loves this camera and it takes great pictures.  So easy and fun to use.  A must for every girl to have!
I purchased 15 of these in assorted colors for a theme party.  Everyone also received a small photo album and two packs of film with instructions to use it tonight!  So much fun with a group of 30-40 yo women who had Polaroid cameras growing up.  Everyone enjoyed the photo keep sakes and then they took them home where their children had fun playing with the camera.Only downside is the coast of film at almost $1 per picture.  In the digital age you have to remind the kids every shot counts!
Bought this for my daughter for her birthday--she's used it nonstop since.  One caveat--the photos are about half as wide as typical Poloraids were when I was growing up--only about 2 inches wide.
I love it!!
my daughter loves this camera she is always taking pictures with it
My Grand daughter is just having TOO much fun with this. It was a Christmas gift. Now all she wants for gifts is more film. Pictures are clear and "fun" size.
Made a great gift for my best friend, she loves it and was so happy to receive it. It's adorable, lightweight, and intuitive to use, even for people who are used to digital photography.
My daughter loves it. Brings back some old memories
I am absolutely in love with this polaroid camera!! It works wonderfully and produces quick and well-processed pictures easily. The film can be expensive so buying in bulk is usually the best option. Although the camera is difficult to fit in small-medium sized purses for day trips, it's a vacation must and an adorable accessory!!
A good buy for my daughter for Christmas she loves the camera and she gets a lot of use out of it only problem is is it's disposable film so expect to pay a lot and keep on paying for film
Got it opened it and loved it takes awesome pictures that look real retro
It captures great pictures. It's actually my new favorite toy. I love it so much. Good for travels, I wouldHighly recommend.
I love love love this camera!
I'm over joyed with this! No complaints!!
Very cute'' nice for unedited, candid pictures. Let be real, I hadn't developed the pictures on my phone for over 3 years! And now I have a ton of pictures :) yay love it! I would never have tangible pictures for scrapbooking ''''''
My daughter loves it. Works great.
So much fun!
BEST PURCHASE I'VE EVER MADE!!! I'm so in love with this camera and the price was great and shipping was so fast! Thank you 💕
Bought this as a Christmas present and wasnt used straight away and tesed to see if it works. It does not work. Bateries and film inside, it turns on a red light but the shutter button does not work to take a picture. Dissapointment
Retro!  My daughter has a chance to see how my parents did it back in the day.  She has pictures on the wall already.
Loved it, super cute, awesome pictures, but after a few days, the pictures in the sunlight come out with "ghost-like" marks, like white shadows. Pretty upset about it
Love it !
Awesome Product!!
GAVE IT AS A GIFT TO OUR GRAD DAUGHTER
It is a nice camera, but it was suppoused to came with 20 pictures, and it came in an open box and just the cam. I think I was stolen somehow...
very nice for 1st camera for my grandaughter,she loved it!
Great camera, does exactly what it says on the box, four stars because the film is pricey, understandable in this day and age but still a little more than I'd like to pay. The camera is a great price though. Build quality is stellar, the lens mechanism feels well made and the camera feels like it will stand up to a lot. We're using it at our wedding, great for a wedding scrapbook.
Absolutely cute!  I didn't even realize there were different editions when I ordered this. It's the newer model and my daughter was very happy. Grabbed the accessory variety pack to go along w it. Very pleased with the products and services.
We live in an age where smartphone cameras and social media have made photography and digital content accessible to just about anyone, at anytime, and at any place. Scrolling through Instagram and Snapchat feeds is both entertaining and sometimes adventurous. I am constantly amazed at people’s creativity.But sometimes our propensity to binge on media can dull our senses and cheapen our experiences. The intangible but infinite nature of digital content can leave us wanting. I mean, who hasn’t stayed up until the wee hours of the night browsing through their phone, wondering why life feels so empty in that moment? Existential crises have a tendency to arise when we sit unchecked in front of glowing blue screens.This is why I really appreciate instant film cameras. They are self-limiting. Taking a photo requires us to slow down and really think a shot through. And only one person can take a photo home. Pictures and memories become what they once were: rare, precious gifts.For these reasons I purchased the Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera for my wife. We instantly fell in love with it. For someone who wants their gear to be as artsy as the pictures they take, the Instax Mini 8 is the best instant film camera you can buy. The name of the product is a mouthful but it’s form and function are simple.FormThe Instax Mini 8 has a solid build quality and doesn’t feel cheap. My wife usually carries it in her purse and we’ve yet to find any discernible scratches on the body. However, if you are concerned about scratching the lens you can find cases online.The camera just looks good. The angles and curves are elegant, giving off less of the “box-look” found in other instant cameras. These curves make the camera comfortable to hold, whether you’re taking normal pictures of selfies. There is also a vast selection of colors to choose from to fit personality type or outfit.FunctionThe camera has two buttons. The button adjacent to the lens turns the camera on and the other functions as the shutter. They’re simple to use and unobtrusive to the design.The Instax Mini 8 also has different aperture settings depending on the lighting and environment. It will automatically recommend the best setting for you with a flashing LED.The viewfinder accurately frames shots. Pictures will come out looking like what you see in the viewfinder. The film chamber is also in the back. Inserting and ejecting film cartridges is quick and easy. There is also a film counter on the bottom right that displays the remaining amount of film in the camera.Image quality is what you’d expect from instant film. It is crucial to use the correct aperture settings on your shots. I accidentally used the indoor lighting setting at times so the pictures came out brighter than we expected.I can’t recommend the Instax Mini 8 Instant Camera enough. It makes a perfect gift for your wife, friend, girlfriend, or yourself. The pictures it takes will have a personal touch to them that will mean more to you and whoever you share your pictures with.This review was originally published by Geekskills at WordPress.
I love it! If buying a Polaroid, buy a lot of film and have fun with it. I've received a lot of compliments, it's easy to use, make sure to check the lighting settings before taking a picture!
Buy this camera. Just do it.
I got this for my 10 year old niece but I ended up using it all night long. I loved it. The pictures look great, the caMera is nice and solid and it looks cute. My niece loves it as well and has done lots of diy photo projects with it.
Works great!!! So cute and such a great idea. My friends have even bought their own after using mine. Highly recommend.
I am sending this back for a refund.  The color and clarity of the pictures is terrible.
We bought this for our 12 year old daughter who loves snapping photos of everyone and was wanting to start scrap booking (but I was rarely wanting to stop everything to print for her).The camera is simple enough she's been able to figure out how to use it with minimal help, she's thrilled with it and loves being able to instantly have her pictures.It's definitely just the old polaroid idea - just with smaller pictures (in a bit cuter format). Definitely stock up on the extra film though, we've noticed she does go through it ;-) And it does have to be bought separately.
It's nice..
Love it! The film is a little smaller than I expected but it had great quality, easy to use, relatively compact. The film packs are 10shot ea. so be sparing! The different light sensing modes work pretty well. All of my films have been clear and look awesome. Great deal here on amazon also.
Fast delivery & good product
My daughter thought this was the greatest thing ever made, she did not know the joys of an instant camera and had fun using this with her friends
Love the product! The manual is came with was easy to read and understand. A must-have for anyone who loves taking pictures!
New, unopened and in good condition.No fails yet.4 stars as the delivery was a bit later than the est. delivery.Overall happy with the product.
LOVE THIS CAMERA! So glad I bought it, its so much fun to use and it takes really good pictures if you make sure to change the light settings. I've dropped it probably 15 times too and sometimes from pretty high up and its still working. So its durable but obviously I don't recommend dropping it. I should probably buy a case for it at some point.
Everything great as expected
No problems with the film, easy to use.
Well my product never arrived but I am very grateful to Amazon for fixing my problem fast! I went out and purchased one of these at target (it wasn't this pretty color of course) and I am very happy with my purchase. Will definitely be buying another as a gift.
my granddaughter loves it!
Bought camera for wedding
I think the pictures should be a little better quality than what it produces.  When I was young, the pictures weren't so off in a distance.  You literally have to get on top of your subject in an effort to get a half-way decent picture of them.
Thank you.
Great mini camera.  Picture quality was ok for selfies.. My niece enjoyed it
Great present for my teenage daughter.
Girlfriend loves it
Love it! So cute and light. Everything I expected it to be and more!
great camera, my daughter loves it
I love my mini camara, it takes beautiful pictures. definately will take it with me my next vacations. wish did't have to order the case and other things separate.
I like the camera
Great gift for a tween!
My daughter loves this camera, particularly the selfie feature.  These are small photos, but perfect for what she wants them for.
Everything I expected! :)
best Polaroid ever. 100% recommend!
This camera is the cutest thing and works so well! I love it!!
Very bad item
Love
Very well received and thoroughly enjoyed.  Great photos too!
My daughter uses it when her friends come over, but is a little to large for a teenager to travel with.
I love love loveee it. I was a bit hesitant to buy it because of the price. Great quality for the the price. And it literally shipped in one day. So satisfied 🙌🏼
Its cool. Love the color, shape and size.  The only drawback is its a bit hard to figure out the light setting to use in different situations.  It takes a couple pics to get it right.
Amazon prime
Wonderful product
Amazing i live it
Had no problems with it! (: MUST GET!
Once you passed the initial emotion, you realize this is not practical nor economic to use.  So If you have the extra bucks and don't care small unique pictures (no copies possible), then it's a nice TOY.  I bought this for my doughter, she's happy with it... so far.  Let's wait until picture cartridge is finished... :(
This is such a hit with friends. I have used this at a friend's baby shower for guests to pin photos with a wish for the baby written on them and also took it to a nearby orphanage. The photos are a great party favor.
I bought this for my daughter's 11th birthday. She absolutely loves it. It's easy to use and the cartridges are simple to put in. The film is a little expensive but she loves this camera. She's putting together a scrapbook with her pictures. I wish I would've bought one for myself.
this camera honestly is the best thing ever.. i was kinda iffy to buy at first because of all the things people were saying about it being defective but so far it's turned out great. this one thing i really love about it is that the cameras flash will literally make your face look flawless af.
Awesome small camera to carry around anywhere and takes very cute unique photos! Love love love mine
My fifteen year old loved it.  She and her friends were bewildered by the development of the pictures.
The rasberry color is NOT PINK! It is RED! My daughter was disappointed so I just wanted to let you know. Also does not come with any film so be sure to order some.
The picture pops out the top like a toaster! Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehe
great pictures
A fun camera. Having a tangible image in-hand seems to be bring excitement back to photography, especially, to the "miliennials." I hope Fuji can increase the format size, in the future.
I love this camera.!
Awesome
It was really nice and pictures came out great awesome gift for my girlfriend and it was a quick delivery very nice!!!👏👏👏
I was missing the side piece for the battery and the inside battery metal was bent i couldn't even get the battery in it. Overall bad condition the focus also springs back and doesn't even click it's a swap meet quality and I'm returning it tomorrow SMH.
SERIOUSLY SO MUCH FUN!!! buy this camera! i love love love it. nothing like the instant gratification an instant film camera gives you. :)
Super cute color. Pics are very good quality!
so fun a bit bulgy, but i love it!
Absolutely great. This tiny camera takes some of the best pics ever. I very highly suggest this product
They only reason my wife gave it 2 stars is because the color is not as advertised. Awesome camera but we had to return it. We ordered the "Raspberry" color but got a weird faded looking, red color. I put a picture down below. It looks even more strange in person. Returning for the regular "Pink".
My daughter loves this camera!  Pictures come out clear & camera quality is great!  Def brings it back to when I use to use a polaroid 30 years ago.  ;)
Feels cheap.  Takes terrible pictures.  Half of the pictures never developed so I suspect the film is bad.  Will try a new film but do not hold out much hope.  Very disappointed!
It was everything I expected. I was worried about buying it but its simple, affordable, and just everything I expected.
Works good. But is weak with poor ligth
The camera does not work when we got it... probably not a good quality so now i have to look for another brand
Nice
This was my 7 year old niece's favorite birthday gift, she flipped out.  She wouldn't stop playing with it all day, carried it everywhere with her.  The only bummer is the cost of the film, it's a little high.
Bought this for our girls for Christmas - they have had so much fun with it. Easy to use. Easy to load the film into.. of course they are going through a lot of film but thier smiles and laughter even it out!
I ordered this for my daughter & she loves it.
INSTANT PCITURES! My wife absolutely love this camera. It brings a totally different feel to taking pictures knowing that it is limited, unlike the unlimited photos on a phone. There's always the mind set that it costs over $1 per picture though we always have to make sure our smiles are right. Every picture so far has been great. The retro look is cool.
Works as expected.
LOVE IT! It's so fun to capture memories with this Instax camera! I got mine for $65 when my friend got hers in stores for $100!
My daughter loves her new camera.  Color is nice and bright.  Easy to use.
Great camera! Bought this for my 10 year old daughter, she loves it. Takes nice pictures.
I absolutely love this!!! It met my expectations greatly!
Grand daughter loves this camera. Now older daughter wants one!
Love it! Film is too expensive though!
Bought for my daughter for Christmas and so far it has been good. Takes good instant photos. Not professional or digital quality. Great for my kids to make scrap book or photo albums.
I just received my fujifilm instax mini 8!!! So far, so good! It is everything I expected it to be. I hope it continues to be a well worth buy. <3
This camera is cute! I ended up returning it because I just didn't see myself using it, but it's an awesome gift for kiddos !! Brings back memories
Very cute, soft yellow color. Takes great insta photos. We took this with us to NYC and my daughter used it to take photos of the sights in NYC. It takes great photos and it's a blast from the past with the insta photos.
love it
Extremely cute I love it
It doesn't work at all. Do not know why. Doesn't turn on. I check the batteries. Use a nwe pair because I thought that maybe the included were wrong but nothing :'(
A pretty cool device but their are some flaws on it. The switch botton is kinda near the view finder. It would cause ur finger to block it. Sensor can be improve making it faster to.switch mode. Great buy for a price but the film is kinda pricy. So make sure make a great pose and smile before you shoot.
Awesome little camera with a vintage look!
I received the camera and the seal was broken on the bottom of the box and there was no inside. The box looks very Worn.  stinks because I'm giving as a gift. I'm asking for replacement.
My 24 year old daughter has LOVED this since the day we got it! Film is a little pricey, but you know that before you buy it, so worth it in our book!
loveee!
I'm in love with this camera the moment I opened it in the box!!! This is so fun and so cute!!!
I really like my camera. I got the raspberry color and its almost a rust color so its not too girly for my husband to snap a picture here or there.The only con is that the pictures I took inside were a little darker than Id like.
I'm in love with it! great product!
My 11 year old loves this!! It is reminiscent of the pics you seen as a kid but better and a little smaller so cool!!
Absolutely love this camera!!
Cool camera and even cooler pictures.  Perfect for our 8 year old.
Brand new, item came as described and love the instant pictures! Very happy and glad I decided to buy this.
My four year old had so much fun with it! Easy to aim and shoot! And he did all 20 pix well!
Love it!!!
perfect
Pictures are not that great but my daughter llikes it.
Works great! Cute design
great camera for my teenage daughter.  The film is rather costly
daughter loves it
Great camera and perfect gift. Only downside is that it does not come with film so be sure to purchase film with the camera!
Great camera came in 6 days new awesome quality it was exactly how I expected
I bought this camera for my girlfriend on our anniversary and she loved it so much!
Came a day later than 2-day priority.
This camera is amazing. The photos look great, the camera is easy to use. 10/10.
Easy to work with. Lots of fun.
Best substitute since the polaroid 600 :)
I love the camera but the pics are very small. When the pics come out, the actual size of the pic is Smaller than the size of a credit card.
Received the camera, followed all the directions, went to turn it on and NOTHING!!! It doesn't work at all!! Getting my money back!
So amazing!! Pictures even better than I thought they would be!
I brought it for my daughter for Christmas and she love it as well as others. I tell them that I bought it off of Amazon.  I like the little photos it reminds me when I was a little girl we had cameras that printed out poloriod it comes to show you how things have a way of coming back around
She is off at college and just loves it!
Excellent
I love this little camera. Shipping took a little longer than I hoped for but product is great. Fun, portable and cute. Went through so much film already. Only thing about it, is you have to make sure you put the light setting on the one it tells you to or your pictures may turn out over lighted or dark.
Great buy 😁
Got this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  Unfortunately I had to send it back because it wouldn't print pictures.
small pictures but good for what it does.
So cool and nostalgic with great picture quality.  Was a gift for my 8 year old and she had no problem taking great pics and was very easy to use and very fun!
Love this item!! Great buy! Great quality !
Granddaughter loved her birthday gift. Film is a little pricey but she is using the camera wisely.Well packaged.
Good deal.
Bought as a gift for my daughter. She loved it!!
Bought this for daughters 18th birthday! She loves it! Little bit of a learning curve with framing the shot. Takes me right back to the 70's!
This camera has made my life a whole new world XD I love it I have taken so many pics with me and my friends and family they love it too I bought this thinking this camera is my first make the best of it and from the first day It arrived  (on my birth day) I was so happy Amazon said that it would be here on Feb first I was so sad then it said it was coming right at 8 o-clock on my birth day I was so happy and I could take some pics while some people where leaving it came just in time and my birth day was the best the Amazon
I rarely leave reviews but this time I feel this camera is worth the trouble. I bough two of these one for me and one for my daughter as a gift. We both love it and recommended it for my brothers. I took it to the family gathering and gave it to the children to take a few shots. We laughed a lot at photos taken by them and one of my brothers said he'd bring one for his daughter. It is sold in a bookstore here in Riyadh but it is cheaper at Amazon. I like the accessories especially the frames and the album. In fact, this is the main reason we bought it. I am giving it 4 stars because the picture is too small. It is not good to capture events or scenes. It is good for selfies with friends and family.
Bought for my daughter....LOVE LOVE LOVE...it's an instant camera so the pics look a bit vintage.  If you want digital quality, buy a digital camera.  If you want a super cute vintage print to hang in the shappy chic room...this is for you.  Pics are approx credit card size.
This was for my ex girlfriend u.u never got to enjoy it.
Cool!
Finally a gift for my teenage granddaughter she really likes and uses!
Arrived as expected
Got one for my sister and she loves it
It is a really good camera
Poor quality photos but retro, I suppose.
Poor picture quality plus film that cost about $1 per shot = terrible product.
Huge hit and Amazon had the best price!
Loved it! Just what i expected!
Happy with my product!
Our granddaughter is having fun with the camera
Excellent, easy to use, love the size of the photos! They are so fun to watch develop.
Bought for my 6 year old and she absolutely loves it. Pictures are clear and the camera is very sturdy. Has been dropped several times and still works with no issues.
My daughter loves her new camera, came fast too
Love it
Fun little camera.  My 12 year old daughter LOVES hers!!
I bought this for my daughter. Film is pricey but it is what she wanted.
Bought this for my little sister. She loves it! I wish film was cheaper but it's great anyways.
Love this. I've wanted one for so long. I wish the pictures were a little bigger. But I knew what I was getting, so no effect on the rating.
Came just as expected ! Came in perfect condition! Also came with batteries and a string for the camera. Absolutely love it !
Just as advertised.
Works PERFECTLY! Such a worth it buy. (:
Great product
5 star
The Polaroid camera is back! We have had a lot of fun using this camera in a variety of ways. You go through the film very quickly and it isn't cheap. I wouldn't use this on a regular basis, but for special parties and events it is a lot of fun.
love it!
My daughter loves this instant film camera. Fuji should have 2 types of film, the current size and the original polaroid size. Other than that, works great.
A
The official camera, so cute and so pretty
It did not come with film :( had to wait a long time before I could take any pictures because I had to order the film separately but it came with batteries!
My daughter has had so much fun taking Pics :)
Such a fun camera! Really great for scrapbooks or wall decor. People always complements and adores the photos and the camera whenever they see it.
Great for fun projects!
Arrived very fast!! cute camera my niece loves it
So much fun to use!
Works well. Came complete. No complains
This is so much fun and good pictures
Lens got stuck within first week
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Perfect gift for s teen. My teenager loves it!
Wasn't sent in English and have to send it back its not taking pic there all blank
Very simple to use, just point and shoot. Great for all ages to use. I love the spontaneity and novelty of the pictures (which most people may not). The softness of colors, slight viginettes, and other effects due to the nature of the camera make every photo look vintage. I will attach some photos when I have time. For first time instant camera owners, I'd recommend buying a bulk pack of film (even if you don't get a lot of user-errors with photos, you'll just want to keep taking and taking them) as well as an accessories set if you like to play around with photography. I purchased the NODARTISAN package, which brings lots of cute filters, a case, and other items.
Fell off the couch and broke after 1 week
bought this for my son and hes had fun with it.
I was about to give five stars for this review when I found out that the strap of the camera was missing. Ouch
Excelent purchases
Love this product! The film is expensive but definitely worth it. Photos come out great!
bought it as a gift and my daughter loves it
Scored some nice girlfriend points for this camera.... thanks!!!!Works as expected, and its really fun too!
This camera was bought for my daughter who absolutely loves it!
Great gift to give
This camera works real well and good for the price. I use it plentiful and no problems so far. It is well designed and better than the previous model. I recommend getting this and a designed film to make the photo look even better! It is easy to use and lightweight! I would've liked there to be a little more to the camera but for the price it is fair.
Love this camera! Everyone had so much fun taking pics with this at the birthday party! & Everyone wanted one after they played with it! =] It was a really cute and clever party favor for the parents and kids to take home with them! I think the picture turns out really nice as long as your up close and personal with good lighting! =]
didnt work... felt so bad for my daughter she was really looking foward to it
100% PERFECT!
Camera arrived faulty, pictures do not develop at all no matter how much film I use
Love it. Takes cute pictures
The camera it's self is amazing only thing is if you get it there is no film with the camera. You would have to go but it separately. When I got mine the battery wasn't working,So if you get it make sure you have film and extra batteries .
great
My granddaughter is having so much fun with this camera.
Easy to use, super cute and portable. This does not come with written English instructions, but picture instructions, which at first were slightly confusing, but ultimately understandable. It is a hit at all parties I take it to!
This camera is incredibly cute, and as an owner of the rose one, I must say that I love the color. It also has a nice weight to it without being heavy, and pretty easy to use.
This camera is super cute and instant. I loved it ! I got it very fast and had no problems with it whatsoever ! It's the best . No regrets ! :)
Nice
Doesn't work, all pictures come out white after using 2 separate film roles, both came out white. Very disappointed with this purchase.
Fun little camera to play with!!
Great love it
I love it. It takes great pictures.  The only problem was that none of the directions were in English . We used the pictures and common sense to put it together.
How can you not love a Polaroid? This is awesome plus it was for a discount, win win for us! Even my little girls likes to play with it !
My daughter loves this camera
My niece is in love with this camera! I got it for her for Xmas and she is so happy with it. The pictures come out really nice and it's nostalgic for everyone to see Polaroids again!
I LOVE ITTT!! <3 its so pretty :3..It come with battery and the strap... It came within a week and two days for me. Packaging is in good hand/ wrap in bubble wrap haha. But still need to learn how to take a really good picture ahah
soo cute!
Such a fun camera.  Easy to use.  We purchased for our 14 year old as a birthday gift.
This camera and case arrived on time and brought a huge smile to my granddaughter. She loves it.
I ordered a black one and from the day I started using it I knew it was totally fake because it wouldn't change the filters at all. I'm going to return mine asap and I expect my money back.
Great
Purchased for 9 year old daughter.  Nice camera, very expensive film.
I bought this as a birthday gift for my 9 year old niece. She loved it and thought that it was really cute. The adults loved it too because it reminded us of the old Polaroid cameras from our childhoods!  The only negative is having to buy film.
Okay, but a bit of a teen toy.  Does not take quality photos at all, but it was fun for a party.
Super fun. Wish the film wasn't so pricey. I've been toting this thing around with me everywhere.
My sister loved her gift!
Daughter loves it.
This was order for my sister and she absolutely loves it! It's a gorgeous color.
Came fast love it
Takes a great picture
My granddaughter loved her Christmas present.
Delivered as defective-> flash did not work. I purchased this right before my tralvel date, so i could not claim so unlucky
My daughter in law love it!
I was a bit disappointed on the delivery time it was late. But my daughter loves it.
Very nice! My niece liked it very much. =)
I got mine in the mail today. SO EXCITED. I took the first picture & the flash was extremely dull. The picture came out black. I tried researching how to fix it online & it said the best solution was to replace the bulb for the flash. :( Sounds like too much of a hassle for me. So I wanted a thing of film & am getting ready to return it. I bought another one because I still REAALLY want one. hopefully this one works! fingers crossed
Came right on time. Great product! !
Such an amazing camera!
My daughters favorite Christmas present.
Great product, pictures come out great
Loved it. Great purchase
Love this camera.
My mom loved this Christmas present!!!!!!!!!!!
Very good. Love the price.. works PERFECTLY....
absolutely love my little camera! shipped in under a week and it hasn't left my side since!
my grand daughter loves her camera!
Love this camera so much! Utterly obsessed, would definitely recommend this!!
This item is great my daughter loves it, and I received on the day I was given.
Adorable camera. Brings back the timeless Polaroid like no other.
I got my camera in Grape and it was my present to myself for working so hard all year. I love this camera. My son loves it because a picture slides up at the top lol
Bought it for a gift and my niece loved it.  Great product
Girlfriend loves it, takes  small but clear pictures and the custom Polaroid film makes it even cooler.
Camera ok but didnot receive any instructions so just have to guess at how to use.
Nice
12-year old daughter had no trouble figuring out how to get it loaded and ready to snap photos.Of course, first thing she did with the photos was take pictures on them with her tablet to post on Instagram....
The camera was a gift for my granddaughter and she's delighted with it.
love it.
Very good
Loving this camera!
I am so happy that I got this! I was literally screaming and everything while I was opening it and putting the film in. Thank you so much! Mine doesn't make a suppose 'sound' when you turn it on, but I don't really care. Buy this!
Thank you; what I wanted.
Great birthday present for my daughter.
A bit expensive for what you get. Disappointed that you don't get any photo paper.
Nice camera. Although it's easy to waste a shot because the settings aren't highly customizable. Also, once you're out of film, there's no point in using this camera! I wish I bought the Snap Polaroid because it's SD card supported. But hey I don't care because this was a gift to my GF and she liked it. So.... Whatever!
My Granddaughter was happy to get the extra film. She us having lots if fun with her friends.
This is a great and easy camera to use. It is a great quality camera that you can carry around with you at all times.
Just what she wanted. Thanx.
Not for everyday.  Film is $$. But fun to mess around with.
This camera is fantastic!  These marketing folks really need to pat themselves on the back for bringing Polaroid-style cameras back.  The color is so beautiful and I just know my daughter will love it!  (P.S.  I want one for myself O_O)
love it. pictures are so cute!
Wish the viewer was correct and didn't have to move the lens right and up to center photo. Why even put it in there? Camera itself is pretty freaking awesome though. Love giving photos right away to people. 4/5.
Worked for 1 day.  The settings dial stopped working.  Now it will only take pis with a flash
absolutely LOVE this, reminds me of being a kid again! highly recommend!
daughter is very pleased
Got this for my 15 year old daughter for Christmas!  She loves it!! The only problem is gonna be buying all this film!!
Fun camera
This camera is awesome,it's light and easy to hold. It takes really cool looking photos too. It's a great choice if you want an instant camera but can't afford the old Polaroid film.
My granddaughter loves this camera.  Reminds me of my childhood polaroid only better.  The pictures are very clear too.
Pictures are very small.
Super nice!!!
I really happy with this purchase
This is a retro throwback to the Polaroid cameras of the 70's and early 80's.The pictures that come out look awful due to fixed lens focal length, and it has to process the shot internally.If you have won the lotto or are a silver spoon trust fund baby by all means get one, but at $1.00 per picture for film you would be crazy to buy this thing in my opinion. My daughter begged for one for Christmas and I told her she had to buy the film, it went against every fiber of my being to purchase such antiquated tech. Now that the film all gone it's a paperweight laying around the house.It's well built, seems to function ok so far, it comes in god awful colors at least I bought the black one, if it was pink or baby blue I would have tossed the paperweight that it is with no film, out the window.Don't buy this it's antiquated junk in my opinion.
Well received. Work great.
Bring the good old days back with this one. You wont get HD prints out of this but you will get a quality photo right then and there. The camera itself seems built to last. It may be a bit pricey for the technology but as always Amazon had the best price that I found at any box store.
I was super pleased at how easy it is to use and the fact that you can write names, dates etc on the bottom of it
Love!!! Absolute love
It's a neat little camera, but we seem to get a lot of pictures that won't develop.
Favorite gift of Christmas!  Love the retro design and color.
LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera. Easy to use, I haven't dropped it so I wouldn't know how durable, but it's plastic so I guess it'd be ok if your clumsy. Takes swell pictures. Sometimes the pics come out too dark, but it's not the cameras fault. Bad lighting is all. I recommend this. And the price is fair.
Very fun to use but the camera hole is kinda small hard for people with glasses to get a good picture
funky
This was a big hit at our Christmas Party!  Everyone kept asking where I had purchased it.  Amazon has everything!
A+++++
Awesome!!!
Doesn't come with any of the paper (film).  Gave as gift only to watch all at the party wonder what a picture might look like.
This camera is so cute and came in very good packaging also. I recommend to buy it here since its much cheeper for the same product you buy at any other store for $120. I got the Blue one amd its the same exact color as shown!
Bought for my 11 year old for Christmas and has lived it. Film is a little pricey, but she's learned to be more selective with pictures she takes with it.
Device as expected! Good stuff and very fast arriving to my place
Bought it for vacation
it was for my 10year old niece and sent it to Korea. my brother  opened it for her and did turn on by instruction. he said the camera turned on but after one time trying to take picture, the film jammed and never worked again. I need refund!! it turned out to be a ashamed gift. I am so upset. \./
The camera was a favorite Christmas gift and the yellow was the perfect color choice for my granddaughter.  (Made me a really popular grannie)
Love this camera. Was a perfect gift for my daughter. She loves the fact it prints the picture after you take it. Only downfall is it can only do ten pictures on one thing of film and that gets a little pricey. But all in all great camera and great gift.
I got this for my 8 year old. She loves it.
My 19 year old daughters favorite gift!
I bought it for my sister, and she absolutely loves the camera, the pictures always turn out really pretty, everyone looks good on the pictures, alwaays haha.
It is the best!!! It is so easy to use and so much fun.
My 13 year old daughter was very excited
My daughter was happy!
Granddaughter loves this camera.
Great throwback to the original Polaroid cameras! The pictures are small, but right up the alley to my daughter who received it as a gift.
The picture came out dark but I my daughter loves it so I guess it works out
It's big and bulky. But that's to be expected. The pictures are small and usually dark. You can still see the image, but darker than usual. It still has that blurryness like the old pics.
Loved IT
Love it
All good.
Love it! Picture quality came out wonderful
Arrived very fast. Great quality.
This is one of my favorite products that I have bought recently.  It is very user-friendly and easy to use. My 9-year old niece can operate it easily.You would not believe how excited people get when this comes out at a party or event!  The older crowd gets that "Polaroid nostalgia" and those that are too young to remember instant cameras are completely fascinated by it!
I bought this on June 25th and it will not work. The pictures either turn out black or white, I've read and followed all of the instructions and it said that my camera needs to be sent back. I payed more than $60 dollars for a camera that does not work so I would like to have my camera replaced. I've wasted 3 packages of film trying to get it to work.
Love it!
My daughter really enjoys her camera.  She needs more film.
I bought this for my little sister (age 14). She didn't ask for this gift or expect it. The look on her face was priceless when the picture came out of the camera.You have to get up really close to people when you take the picture. Keep this in mind since the film is very expensive.
Loved it! Used it at a Hannukah community event to take pics of kids and the kids put them in the holiday frames they decorated. Obviously the pics don't come out like regular photos with normal camera, but I didn't expect it to. Kids really enjoyed it. Only problem is that as all the reviews stated, the film is very expensive. I wish it were cheaper. Otherwise, GREAT camera, GREAT price, GREAT buy!
I bought this for my 11 year old daughter for a Christmas gift. It was the only thing she asked for. It was exactly as described and is so easy to use. We've both had fun with it!! The only problem I have is the film is pretty pricey for only 10 pictures per package of film.All in all I'm super happy with the purchase and so is my daughter!
Bought this for my 12 year old. It was exactly what she wanted. Easy enough for her to set up and put film in even without reading directions.
I love this thing so much, I'm buying both my nieces one for Christmas.
My graanddaughter requested this camera for Christmas and seems pleased with it. I bought the warranty for loss or breakage because she has lost a camera in the past.
Súper dooper!! WHAT a blast!!!
It's a little Polaroid. It's fun to play with.
Granddaughter loved it.
My daughter got this for Christmas & just loves it!  She is having so much fun with her friends & family and is loving the pictures on her wall!
first of all, this camera is amazing. it is super adorable and i love it! the first picture i took came out perfect. after that they were all blank! i checked amazon reviews and i saw that if you take out the package after it is started, the pictures have been exposed to light and they will come out blank. luckily, i had bought a few more packs so i made sure not to mess around with those. just make sure not to open the back after the pack is started, or the pack will be ruined. i gave it four stars because it is perfect but the company didnt write about that and i lost so much money.i just wanted to give you that tip before you start taking pictures.
disappointed the instructions are in Chinese!
exelent
I've been wanting an Instax Mini for years and I finally treated myself! I couldn't be happier. I was able to try out one in person before. I fell in love instantly with a memory developed right in front of your eyes. It's cool to have. I know it's going to be sort of an investment with the film, but I think it makes everything more worth while and buying the twin pack from Amazon is the best deal for that. I've always been a huge fan of photo booth pictures so this camera is right up my alley. I like to really think about the photo before taking it to insure I get what I want. It's nice to think of the perspective and lighting and background of each photo. I just love being able to have a physical copy right away, it's romantic. I also love the pink color of the camera, it's so cute and my friends love it too. The camera shape itself is sort of large in my hands, but it's really easy to use. I'd recommend it if you're interested!
Super cute! I love the pictures. I ordered the camera with the twin pack of film and I'm not sure if you'd get any film if you do not purchase the camera on its own (mentioning this because I almost skipped out on buying the extra film since I assumed it came with some). But all in all I love it!
I was really excited to receive this camera but pretty disappointed that it didn't work on the trip I wanted to use it on. Not really sure what I did wrong because it worked fine inside but when I tried to take pictures outside it wouldn't develop properly. Guess I have to stick to taking pictures inside.
Other than the fact that the product was not I'm English it works great. Good thing we didn't need to read the directions.
Camera feels more like a toy, not a real camera. Pictures are just for fun. Not great quality.
great for a gift or something fun for yourself. i bought an extra pack of film separately but it does come with a pack of 10 prints!!
my 14 year old daughter loves it! Great keepsakes of memories instantly! Christmas was extra special this year!
great
Daughter laugs and cute
Fun camera, takes great photos in any lighting situation. Great choice for an instant camera and the film is much cheaper than polaroid exposures.
bought this for my gf she loved it exactly what i expected and what she wanted worth the money and there pretty durable drop it about twice already still works perfect lol
Camera works as expected taking excellent photos!
This is a super fun camera. Enjoyed it at Christmas went the family. The teenagers actually enjoyed it!  Perfect credit card size pics. I've given twice as a gift I since my  original purchase!
Bought this for a Christmas gift. They seem to be happy with it.
This camera would have been worth 5 stars had the camera not came in with technical malfunctions. It was stuck on one setting the entire time, the houses symbol setting. Taking any picture outside and the photos always came out either all black or white. Even pictures inside weren't guaranteed as they came out completely dark most of the time. I just requested to return it to buy another one but upset I've gone through 30 film sets with the majority printing out ruined.
My daughter absolutely loves this camera! We got it for her for Christmas, the color is so pretty! It actually takes good quality pictures as well, the only downside is the film can be a bit pricey but besides that we love it!
Great gift for my Mom and sister. They love it. Thanks!
Can not say enough about this camera.  It brings back memories of the true polaroid camera.  The pictures come out so well.  Small enough to take anywhere, and the pictures develop instantly.
Santa sent this camera to my 5 yr old daughter. She figured out how to use it in minutes but I have to load the film. She's obsessed and uses it constantly for her artistic expression. Silly girl even took it to Walmart to capture her day.
I love this camera.  The film is sorta expensive but it's totally worth it.
I LOVE this polaroid camera. I have had this camera for almost a year and the memories captured are amazing. You always need to remember to have extra film when you are out and about to restock. It takes a few test shots to work the camera and know what setting to put it in. It recommends what setting to take a picture with so that suggestion is very helpful.
This camera was the worse purchase I have made in a very long time and my daughter was very disappointed. She was looking forward to document her Christmas break with this camera and could not!The camera turned on but all photos taken indoors where completely black and photos taken outside where so over exposed that they were white!  We thought it must have been the film so we took as many photos in as many different settings as we could to end the film and were hoping for a few good photos but no! The second film came out the same. After waisting $20 on film and have zero photos, I returned the camera. I love amazon for their easy exchange process. We are scared to order a new one but my daughter really wants one so we will try one more time!To me it feels that the exposure system was off and because it is automatic, even if you change its setting manually, the auto takes over. It thought it needed less light when it actually needed more and vice versa.I will update this review when I receive the new camera.
my little sister loves getting this camera for Christmas! it works well and the pictures look great!
small pictures, but accurate
These are awesome! Reminds of when I was a kid.  Anyway easy to use and my 10 year old loves it.
My daughter wanted this so bad for Christmas, so I got it for her. She loves it, but she's also a teenager. This is definitely not caught up to 2016 speed for electronics, but if you don't care about that, it's fun to play with.
I am in love with my Polaroid camera! It was really easy to use and the color looks amazing.
Love this camera! The pictures are small, but they always look great, and it's very easy to use. It's just a standard point-and-shoot camera that anyone can use, and there's a little ring around the lens that you can turn to put it at different lighting settings. The nice thing is that the camera recognizes your surroundings and has a light that tells you which setting is recommended. The pictures print out and develop within a minute, and I know you can buy different types of film with cute borders although I've only used the standard white so far.I have the camera sitting on my shelf when I'm not using it and it looks really cute, and I taped up some hemp cord and got little clothespins to display my pictures on the wall. Like I said, the pictures always turn out looking great simply because they're that "polaroid" style.
Flash works unclear. Many photos are spoiled.
The receiver of this gift has been using it daily since they got it!
Love it. Easy to use.
This is the CUTEST camera for a teenager. There's the instant gratification part because the pictures come out immediately. Mini pics that they can share with friends. The camera is cute and comes in different colors like this sweet pink. Price was right and film is not terribly expensive. Definitely nice when you don't want to go digital.
I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! It's so easy to use and I love how the pictures come out very vintage. The only downside is that the film is expensive.
I originally rated this as four stars but after a few more uses and wasted exposure, I needed to knock it. More than half the time, the film would be exposed for too long resulting in a too light picture. I gave it to a friend so I could be rid of it.  I recommend the instax wide camera.  I've never had a problem with the exposure of that camera.
Love this. It's super fun. I wish I'd had it for my best friend's bachelorette party. I had this great idea to make a little scrap book and have everyone write advice/jokes in it and put a picture of each person on the pages they wrote on. It was a GREAT idea. Six years later I STILL haven't printed the pictures I took. I SO wish I could have had this back then. It would have been PERFECTION!
I liked these fun funky colours!
My mother loves this Christmas gift!!!  Quality is that of polaroid pictures of our youth and that is totally fine!  Easy to operate and load with film.  Great gift idea!!
I am in love with this camera! It is so cute and super easy to use. I can't wait to take more pictures :).
LOOOOVVEEE
cute!
My daughter loved it for christmas
Shoot great photos. In love with it!
I love it takes great pictures
Granddaughter loves it
great
Great looking camera. The color is awesome. For the most part, the pictures develop as expected. I have had some issues with lighting affecting the quality of the picture. All in all, a fun camera.
Bought as a gift and it was exactly what my daughter wanted.  Make sure to buy a case, lots of film, and a coordinating photo album for the mini8 photos.
Works great and love it, lots of fun. Was a christmas present. The settings are a bit confusing but just playing around with it is all that's necessary. Awesome!
Very cute.  Easy to use.  Pictures are not great though.  Obviously, I didn't expect digital quality, but they are all really dark.  Fun for 9 year old daughter, but learned to take pics outside for better quality.  Note that these are not the same size pics as the old polaroid square ones.  These are much smaller.
I've had my camera for a good 5 months now and it works great. The battery life is great the photos are great everything works fine. Picture quality is cool and vintage but you have to remember if the lighting is too bright or too dark the picture won't come out too great. But you'll figure out what works best through trial and error. I took my camera on a trip to New York with me and it took wonderful pictures of the 911 memorial and new World Trade Center building but didn't take good pictures in the dimly lit museum of natural history. I would buy one again I this one ever broke
Such a fantastic product. Easy set up and instructions are simple to set up. Film must be purchased separately. The mini picture quality is excellent! I cannot wait to use my little memory photos for scrapbooking:)
Huge hit at the birthday party.  My daughter and her friends had a blast taking photos that "you can like have".  They shot up 2 packs of film the first day.  And now its sat on her shelf for three months.  It takes pretty poor, tiny, photos.
I am pretty disappointed in the fact in came in 3 days when I have prime, color is nothing like the picture online, it doesn't even come with batteries or film to test it out. Ughh
great!!
I love my new camera
We love this thing and it was a Christmas hit!CON: Didn't realize it didn't come with "film". Had to buy separate after Christmas but that my problem for not reading fine print.
Beautiful
I bought this as a christmas gift for my 14 year old sister and she absolutely loved it and said it was the best gift she's gotten (I won't lie, I loved it too). The shipping took longer than expected and arrived after christmas, but it was worth the wait. The picture quality is wonderful and perfect for capturing memories. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
love it
Great product. I am very happy with it. I would highly reccomend.
Great
This has quickly become my 14 year old's favorite play thing!  She carries it everywhere and is always taking pictures.  I still cannot believe that we are back to polaroid picture taking, but what a cute way to do it!  I do wish the film wasn't so expensive, but my daughter isn't complaining.
My niece uses it all the time! Her favorite Christmas gift.
I got it as a present for christmas from my parents. I picked the pink one put myself and they ordered it for me! It came on time and is amazing with pictures!! I love the Polaroid quality in all my pictures!!
My daughter loves this camera. It's super cute and easy to use.
Bought this as a present for my wife. she loves this camera. She has already used it on many parties including bachelorette party and for granmother's 80th birthday. She used the pictures for a scrapbook and it is a hit at every event.
Such an awesome camera! Was on the fence about buying it, so glad I did! It's prefect for vacations! Easy to use and film isn't too terribly expensive.
beautiful ..
It is a toy, but a lot of fun!
My 11 year old daughter got this for Christmas and LOVES it.  Her and her friends think it is simply amazing!
def sturdy, cute color, but it did not come with the film that it said it does!
Fast shipping, great product!
Love it just didn't come with a strap so that sucks
Fellas, get this for your girl. Be ready to smile. She will love it.
My daughter has had so much fun with this!  Seems to work well.
Purchased this camera for my wife who is a professional dslr photographer. She was super excited about it and still is. It is obviously very different from a dslr and has a learning curve with it, but overall she has enjoyed using it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a little fun with a Polaroid camera.
Getting film in and out of this camera is very difficult. Not like the exact camera I bought at Walmart. That was was much easier. I ordered this one because of the pink but wish I had ordered somewhere else :/
Bought as a gift for my niece, needless to say I am the best aunt in the world this year!
I love it !
Love it so much
My daughter asked for this camera for Christmas. A bit reluctant, I purchased it anyway. I'm disappointed in it though. The view finder doesn't line up with the actual lens, so trying to take a centered picture is a matter of guess work. The cost of the film isn't cheap either, so having to take multiple shots to get it right is pricy. I'd recommend checking out other cameras before getting set on this one.
My boyfriend and I take pictures with this constantly!  Since I bought it he's decided to order one of his own.  The pictures are adorable and so personal.  I think we often forget how sentimental we are; it's nice to be reminded of that.
Love this camera
SUCH a fun camera! The price is pretty comparable to Walmart at times, but still a great buy!
Just received it, tried it and it is working great!
Came packaged very well! Comes with batteries so that's a plus(:
The camera was ok... my daughter liked it, I realize that I should have bought a case because a strap does not come with it and it can fall easily. Also I was a little disappointed that the box and all instructions were not in English.
Works awesome daughter loves it. Fast delivery and packaging was good
Loved it
14 year old loves it, film is pricy but expected
I love this camera. Great for parties or family functions. Everybody loves this little thing and it's a nice and fun ice breaker.
My daughter loves it! A fun way to take old school pictures.
Great product!
Love this! I purchased this for my 7 year old and she is very stoked. The film is incredibly easy to load. Just open the back, line up the yellow marks on the camera and film, and lay it in. One button to turn on the camera, one to take the picture. Simple. The picture comes out fantastic. It does not work miracles, a dark room is not lit up by flash alone. There is a countdown window on the back of the camera that shows how many pics are left. Very helpful. The instant gratification of having a picture in hand is a happy kid maker. On a side note, I ordered the raspberry color, which is slightly more orangey than it is pink. It is not exactly the same as pictured. Very very happy with the camera!
I love using this camera for my art journals. It adds some "old school" feel but saves me tons of time because the pictures are instant. I don't have to remember to go print out the pictures I took. My nieces love my magic camera.
Great picture quality!
This was a Christmas gift that my daughter requested. She loves it.
I love it! The pictures are so tiny and cute. Perfect for making memories!
Beautiful camera, easy to use. Great gift for people of all ages!
It just came in and my girlfriend loves it already. Great to capture those perfect memories.
This is as fun a gift for my 13 year old niece, as it was when i got one at that age ftom my Auntie. The camera is sleek and i got it in white with a key lime case. It is more compact and the film is easier to load than the old Polaroid I had growing up. One notice, the photos are actually about 1/3 the size of the 80s version, but don't let that dissuade you, it's still a wonderful gadget. At about a buck a shot, it also teaches a teen about having budget, since they are so used to clicking 100s of pics with their digital.  Their piggy bank will be empty if they aren't thoughtful about what they shoot!! Best film price by far here on Amazon.
I bought this camera for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. It came in great condition and is stylish and cute. Takes beautiful pictures and its just great overall.  So far this camera is trouble-free. I guess our old time stuff are coming back in style lol
Nice camera.  Takes OK pics, but the film is ridiculous expensive.  $1 per pic taken.
I LOVE IT!!!!!
all perfect, delivery on time!
Purchased this for my daughter for her birthday to take pics of her one year old.  She loves it.  The flash can get annoying indoors, but outdoors it takes great photos.  Please remember these take very small pictures, but it is a fun thing to have, and you can purchase cute little photo albums to place the pictures in, or attach them to the inside of birthday cards and projects.  The film is not cheap, but it's a great little novelty.  The camera is adorable!
It was a birthday gift
My daughter absolutely loves this camera and was super excited about being able to snap a picture and it immediately printing. Ha! What a concept. :)
Love it
Nice camera. Daughter loves it
Great gift
So fun and cute!
Great
I ordered this for my daughter's 13th birthday.  She loves it!
Perfect for "that Polaroid" feel to the pictures. The eye hole is a little small to see out of & I don't like you can't turn off the flash.
All I have to say is buy a case, use it with caution or get the warranty. I've watched two polaroids lenses shatter in the same week.
I LOVE IT! Very compact and adorable and the film is the perfect size !! The color is beautiful and it feels lovely and not awkward. I take it everywhere with me and I love the entire aesthetic of it all. Very good price and aaaaAaaaA I just love it so much !! 💕
Love it! And so does everyone else!!
My eight year old love this!
Loved it!!
I love love loooove this camera! It's the perfect size and takes great Polaroid photos. Definitely buy this if you haven't already!
My favorite Camera! I love how cute the polaroids are and how everyone falls in love with it. Packaged well and shipped on time.
the instructions are not complete so ill have to find more info online. The first pic came out black so i have no idea why it didn’t work and i am afraid to waste film.
I  ought this gift for my gf at the time. She loved it. The film is easy to refill. The functions are straight forward. Not Co fusing at all. One con I could think of is the space between the flash and the button.  I catch my finger to be blocking the flash. Overall it is a great camera.
Works great with my Instax Mini 8, will probably purchase in bulk again
Love this camera so much. Takes great pictures with great quality. Way better than expected. Easy to use and takes batteries that are also provided in the purchase!
Very happy with the fast shipment and great product! Highly recommend!
absolutely love this camera. the look of it is fun and the pictures that come out, are really pretty good quality. film isnt to expensive and my daughter loves this thing, she takes it everywhere she goes.
I can't say enough good stuff about my new Instax mini 8. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT so much! It is so easy to set up, use,and photo quality is excellent. This is the perfect camera for easy, playful shots and instant FUN!Did I mention that I LOVE IT?
It is a great camera, mostly suited for parties since they are so much fun to use, I've used them for a friend's 21st birthday and it was quite a blast. The only drawback is that you cannot "delete" hahaha. It is a film camera, so you are mostly stuck with what you get unless you have TONS of film to waste. However it was really fun to use! So when you use this camera, just make sure you look your best before snapping xD
Thank you!
I think this canera is easy to use and very cute.
I just got my camera maybe 20 minutes go. Shipping was great. The camera is perfect and it is so much fun! The photos develope nicely!
This camara is absolutely adorable! I love the color and how small it is. The pictures come out nicely too. The only thing I don't like it's that it doesn't focus very well when an object is close to the camara, also I don't use the settings provided bc they tend to make the photos come out too bright. I use one setting for all my differently lighting and it seems to work just fine! It is definely worth it.
I absolutely love my camera! It came in perfect condition and on time. I have honestly nothing bad to say about it. :)
Paid $74 and only getting back $62 :(
My daughter wanted this camera for Christmas, and she loves it.  It is like the vintage Polaroid instants.  The pictures are smaller than the vintage Polaroids.  It is a fun party size camera.  I would recommend a close up lens that you can buy separately for selfies, etc as the lens on this camera isn't designed for close up shots.
This camera is so much fun! I just discovered this not to long ago and man I have been missing out! I no longer have to wait for my memories to be printed! I'm having a blast! Also would make a perfect gift.
Pictures look just like old Polaroids. Easy to turn on and comes with batteries. The controls are very easy to understand.
Bought this for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas. She LOVES it and so does everyone else. She was defiantly the most popular at the Christmas party lol! Pictures come out very good and sharp, I love the color tones too.
This was a present for my sister and she loved it , it works great and I will start using it too :)
Having this camera around has caught many wonderful pictures. I really like it
disappointed it does not have the selfie mirror as shown in the photo, had to order an attachment which broke the lens
Just got camera and very impressed. Easy to use and love the pictures.
Daughter loved it, would order again.  Arrived just in time for Christmas.
Takes good pictures. Settings don't change like it supposed to. Stays on one setting is the only downfall
My Grandaughter loves this camera!  Just wish the film was cheaper as she goes through it quickly
This thing is awesome! I purchased this for my gf and she loves it. Nothing like having some good ole fashion polaroid pics
Wonderful product. My sister is definitely excited to have it! Thank you so much for the speedy delivery! I will definitely be buying from you again.
amazing
Didn't realize it didn't come with film. My fault though.
I wish it came with a few test pictures. I had to wait and order some rolls.Overall, the prints are super nice with the Fuji film instant.
Perfect!! Just what I wanted! I love this camera it's so cute and the the only reason I don't give it five stars is because the pictures aren't completely clear but they are pretty dang good!!
Amazing and beautiful
excellent camera - fun stuff!  fun for all ages
Soo disappointed to write that this doesn't even work. I inserted the batteries correctly, the film correctly. Switched to new batteries and a new film pack. It's like the camera is just dead. I was SO excited for this to come, very disappointed
I love this glad they came back in style.
I bought this camera for personal use and it is a lot of fun to use. It is definitely not going to give you National Geographic style photographs, but if you are looking for a fun camera to give you instant memories, then this camera is for you. It is easy to load with new photo sheets and it only takes a few minutes for the photo to turn out. You can turn the lighting option for the camera to your desired setting depending on your location and the camera is ready to use is a few seconds. Overall, the camera is a lot of fun to use and extremely easy to use.
not bad
My daughter LOVES this camera!
I've only had for a few weeks but I love this camera! I wish you could take more than 10 pics with one roll of film but i love this!!!
Love this! It works perfectly. I would totally recommend buying this camera.
Expensive film...
It's a good camera but it's really not worth the price Amazon sells it for but I love the camera
Love this camera. My son loves to get the picture right then and there.
ADORABLE  CAMERA!!!! RECOMEND.... i had no issues with the camera.... best price I could find. It will be something i will use along my day to day... film is small and a little pricey... credit card size, camera picture is true to color.
I was a little surprised that it did not come with film.
I love this little camera. Its small and you can carry it everywhere.
What a fun camera for 10 year old boy! He has been taking his pictures and loving the instant gratification!
Happy with the camera but the order was supposed to come with film and didnt. This was a Christmas gift and it can't even be used..
Great product!
Great product! Shipping was quick too!
Arrived on Tim for Christmas and my daughter loves it!
My 8 year old received this as a Christmas gift and loves going around taking pics of everything with her camera. Beautiful quality, seems user friendly, and who doesn't love a good old instant picture. Great gift for those preteen/tweens as well.
Excellent pictures!! Great quality. Fun for any age. Just snap and go!
Like the çamera, was for my 8 yr old daughter. II was in a rush when I ordered and assumed it had a memory slot - it doesn't- which is why I'm rating a 4. The film is expensive so the çamera should come with memory slot for the price.
I was disappointed that this did not come with film.  They could have included a small amount.
My wife loves it
This a great camera! Got it for my lady as a gift for the holidays and she loves it. Just be sure to buy film with it because it does not come with any (and it's not cheap)
Perfect
My 9 year old loves this. .just wish the film was a little cheaper
Makes a great gift! My daughter loves it.
the best thing I have ever bought
Got this for my daughters 11 bday.  She absolutely loves this.  Works great and is easy to use for an 11 yr old.
Takin it way back!! This camera is amazing! The quality of pics that come out of this are awesome!! Way better than expected! They are very small but so fun for the kids to be able to see there picture physically as soon as they snap it! Love it!!
Very satisfied and it is super cute! I have owned DSLRs and all kinds of camera but this is a great addition to my collection.
A gift for My Granddaughter who's 15 and been wanting one.This was the best deal I could find for it after searching for a time.Easy to use and a hit with Her.Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera (Yellow)
love it!
13 year old loves it!
Great birthday present for my daughter!  Wish Polaroids were a little larger like the old Polaroids I remember, but she has fun with it for the price!
The camera was a gift for one of our kids. Our son really enjoys taking shots and having them print right away. The quality of the prints is only slightly better than the old Polaroid cameras in the 1970s. Still, the camera is both fun and practical. It also has a modern look that draws attention from people who see him use it.
It takes a bit of getting used to in the digital era, you can't edit or delete the pics kids!! It's so great for her to be able to have pictures of friends, pets, whatever... and hang them in her room. (Super cute accessory is chicken wire in a large frame with tiny clothes pins to hang the pics).
the films were small I had no idea but I'm still inlove! fujifilm came with the string to hold it and 2 batteries!
Bought 3 for 3 girls age 11-14 for Xmas, and they love it.  The 11 year old is especially fond of it, but all are using.  I am sure it will not supplant the iPhone cameras, but this is a different, and fun, option.
Takes good pictures and my granddaughter loves it. Only problem is the availability of the paper.  So far we have found it only online.
Love this camera, it takes great photos.
Arrived on time and as advertised.
My fourteen year old daughter received the camera as a gift. She loves it, and she uses it often.  The cost of the film is the only thing that prevents her from using it all the time.  Otherwise, it is durable and works well.
Product as advertised, great shipping time and great price
I LOVE MY INSTAX MINI 8 CAMERA SO MUCH I TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT!!!
What a great product for a gift! My daughter absolutely loved it! Really came in handy during our New Years Eve celebration.
Brings back the old polaroid memories..Very easy to use for the kids. Looks attractive and makes a great gift.  The viewfinder is too small and the picture quality can use an improvement though(kinda washed out in many photos).
I love this camera! We bought it to use for the Photo Booth at our wedding and it was such a hit. The only drawback is the film is a little expensive, but it's worth it and so much fun. Since the wedding I use it in my 4th grade classroom to take pictures of my students doing projects; and I hang the Polaroids around our classroom to make it more personal and show people visiting what we've been up to.
Love this! We've had so much fun playing with it and it's super sturdy for even the kiddos. Brings back memories!
NICE CAMERA FOR OUR GRAND DAUGHTER!
Bought as a gift. Teenage recipient liked it very much.
great product, easy to use, my 9 year old loves it
When I got the camera, the pictures I took were very blurry but I thought that I was just doing it wrong. I convinced my co workers to buy a couple and they did. When they brought them in to the office, all their photos were pretty and clear and cool looking. I was honestly jealous. I can't return it and I really really want a cute Polaroid camera.
Oh my! This is a GREAT gift. I love this camera. Its super easy to use. And pretty self explanatory. If you cant figure it out, or if you want some tips, I watched some YouTube videos and it helped alot! I recommend this camera to everyone who wants a polaroid.
I am addicted, was crushed when they stopped making Polaroids and now I am sooo happy. Film is pricey but totally worth it!
I love this ! It's so fun to have the picture in you hands!!
Awesome buy. Very chic camera. No complaints. Pictures are small but to me they're just right. You can stick it in your wallet,on the fridge,wherever. And the outcome of the pictures is superb. Lovely colors make it a plus.
I've had two Instax Mini 8 cameras, both pink, I lost the first one on a trip so I got me the same one again. Simply love it. The pics come out with this great vintage-looking-filter so you always look good on selfies.
perfect
Like a lot of users, I was looking to recreate the Polaroid experience with this camera. What I got was even better than my vintage Polaroids! I love the shape of the film, the look of the camera, and the resolution of the photos.
Great! Works just as it should! Image true to actual color!
Good fun gift for 8 year-old. Photos are fairly good quality. Fun activity, easy to operate. Film could get expensive, but there are sales sometime. Not much more than an activity; not sure it is for serious photojournalism, but may be good for school reports or fun projects. Photos are slightly smaller than trading card size. Seems to work quite well.
I love this camera it is easy to use, the only problem I have with it is lighting or more accurately what setting to use because some of my pictures come out too dark, other than that it is a good camera and I made a memory wall with all my pictures...I have no regrets
My daughter loves this camera. It is similar to the old Polaroids but the photos come out smaller and clearer. This camera is easy to use and comes in several fun colors. Be sure to buy the film with it. It is not digital.
Gave it as a gift.The coloring is pretty spot on as the picture.Only downside is that it didn't come with film (which I should have checked into), but other than that the product itself is pretty good :)
The item was delivered way before the estimated delivery date. It works and it's cute! I totally recommend it!!
Gift for Grandaughter, she loved it.
My granddaughter LOVED it! Although she asked for a 'Polaroid' after opening this gift she said that this was the one she had been looking at. I hit it all right! Color and brand. The reviews really helped me decide on this one instead of the Polaroid
It doesnt work as much as you expect it too, because it's wasted a lot of film. They just come out blank!
It's so easy to use and so adorable!!! I love this camera so much. My only worry is how expensive the film is but it's cheaper than Polaroid film.
So cute and adorable!! Love the color and pictures turn out great!!
Easy to learn and simple! Came with batteries, and instructions. Film was not included, but it was easy to purchase film.
Love love love it !! Gave it to my 13 year old sister for Christmas and she's in love. Super cute, perfectly taken care of, and i dont know who's happier, me or her!!
Gave this as a Christmas gift to at 16 year old girl. She loves taking pictures and really liked that she could have hard copy photos in the digital age.Pros:Overall, cool modern camera for taking Polaroids.Good variety of colorsCons:I wish there was more focusing abilityMaybe a little smaller and less clunkyBigger viewing window
The color displayed online is more of a pinkish, I just opened it and was very disappointed that it's more of a red/burnt orange. I'm returning it, not to mention I bought it a few days ago for $79 and now it's on sale for $69. That's not the reason I'm returning it, I just happened to see that when I filled out the return info. I hope I get all of my money back. I didn't even take it out of the plastic.
Camera looked ok. Not sure how the original one looks like, but the box this camera came in looks like it was maybe a refurbished camera or who knows. I've seen the box they come in but this box looked like a regular box with a sticker on top saying it was fujifilm instax mini 8. Waiting for my film to arrive so we'll see if it works.
It's so cute! Plus it came in only 3 days! It's in great condition, and I just love it! Definitely recommend buying it!
Love it. My daughter was so excited and spent the day being creative!! Thank you.
My daughter loves this little thing and the quality of the instant picture has come along way from when I had mine in the 80s. Great transaction.
This my very first Polaroid camera, I absolutely love it! it's soooo perfect, it's just everything I expected it to be! Also it arrived super fast and right before New Year's Eve, which is exactly what I wanted! I highly recommend this product it's freakin awesome!!
Came in on time from the expected arrival date :3 It's so cute and I would recommend anyone to buy this. Take note, //definitely// get a case for this to prevent it from getting scratched and/or destroyed :o
Takes dark photos, tested multiple settings on 2 rolls of film, wasted lots of great moments this Christmas and got dark prints in return.  None of the photos of the prints on the product page are accurate.  Manual says set to "High Key" for low light but all this setting does is wash out detail and create blown out bad photos.  Overall camera design is awkward and not intuitive to hold in your hands.  The button you click to take a photo is hard to press.  Basically every single thing about this camera is faulty.
Daughter loved it
So fun to use.
It works really well but your supposed to be able to push the flash thing but it does not work or but budge. Also your supposed switch lighting settings but does not work yes I know it turns automatically on but your also able to switch it by yourself but just stays the same
Love!!!
We bought this for our 15yr old daughter as a Christmas gift and she loves it.  She loves taking pictures with her digital camera, but the Instax Mini gives her something tangible instantly that she can share with her friends and team mates.
I've only had it for like 5 minutes but so far it's so rad. Definitely is mini.
Not the color pictured more of a maroon color. Pissed
Great camera very impressed with service
Great little camera! Purchased for my 11 year old but everyone wants one now! Takes pretty nice pictures!
I've never written a review before until now because that's how satisfied and happy Iam with my new camera!!! I was super excited when my package came which didn't take long at all to arrive (2 days). Packaging of the camera was perfect, there were no damages. When I opened the box it came with a pair of batteries, strap (hand strap, not long), 1 year warranty, instructions and a beautiful camera of course. Everything about this camera is truly amazing, I took a photo of my Christmas tree to test it out. The image didn't come out bad, you just can't see the tree lights. You just have to choose which settings fit your surroundings. I want to keep testing out the settings but as many know the film is somewhat pricey. But overall, the camera is great and would definitely recommend it!!!
Love this camera!
Love it! Cute, adorable and easy to store
This camera and film was  gift for my niece who loved it's ease of use and the fact that the photos develop before "her very eyes".  We received superfast shipping on this item.
Came just as promised and my daughter loves it!
Easy to use . Lightweight. Fun and cute pucs
works perfectly.
everything ok!
Very nostalgic
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my teen, and earned the "favorite present" rating this year!
excellent
SS loves it.
Cutest investment ever!
Great!
Fun camera!
to this amazing Polaroid.  Simple to set up and use.
Purchased for Christmas gift.  I am impressed with the quality of this camera and the photos are quite good.
So cute and perfect, the pictures  turn out really well and mini!
Santa brought this for my 8 year old daughter and she just loved it.  The pictures pop right out and it is reminiscent of the old polaroids we all played with in the past.  Not great picture quality but that is not what this is about.  I bought some accessories and scrapbooking materials that go with this model and my daughter loved using these materials as well.  She filled her scrapbook, made some picture ornaments, etc.  I was so surprised and pleased to see her entertain herself with something other than tv or video games!
Color is beautiful, 13-year old daughter is ecstatic! Highly recommend for the tween set!
I got this for my daughter for Christmas! She love it. My daughter is 10 and she was able to figure it out without my help. Film is expensive but the camera quality and pictures are great for an instant camera.
love it. easy to use and easy instructions
big hit this christmas
It's so adorable. I got it the day before Christmas just like it said & it's perfect! Thank you so much.
Very nice camera!  :o)
I absolutely love my fujifilm instax mini 8! It is great to take a picture and have a hard copy. It is small, so it is very portable. Also keep in mind that the pictures are credit card sized, and not big like the older Polaroid photos. I recommend getting the base with twin pack. It includes the camera and 20 pack of film for a better price.
This was the PERFECT holiday gift! The white is so nice -- I was nervous that it would get dirty quickly, but not at all!
It is super cool when the picture comes out, because you cant see the picture till a few minutes.
My 11 yr old daughter loves this camera and it is a cute idea. I do think it is overpriced considering you can't save the pictures digitally or anything.Easy to use. After the first couple uses though we are no longer able to select the setting (inside, sun, cloudy, etc). It's like it automatically picks no matter what we change it to.
Very cute. My daughter loves it
this camera is AMAZING!  I got it as a gift for my daughter and almost kept it myself!  This camera is so much fun.  all the cool accessories you can get with it, change the colors of the lens.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this for any girl that loves to take pictures.  It's even awesome outside taking scenery pictures.
Hands down love it thank you
Super cute! Takes great pictures. Fun little camera!!
Great product, and shipped quickly! Highly recommend buying.
EVERYONE loves these...  BUY IT!  and buy film and picture frames... can' say enough!  Keeps wife, guests, and teens, SUPER happy...
So far no problems! Just wish the film was cheaper!! Great product though and takes much better pictures than I thought it would. Thanks!! (:
Given as a gift for my daughter. First picture of each package is blank. Each picture is faded in the top left corner. Not what I would expect for the price.
This camera is amazing! brings back old memories and love that not all my pictures are on my phone
I love my mini Polaroid!
My 12 year old daughter's favorite Christmas present this year. Be aware: these photos are MUCH smaller than old instant photos. It is kind of cool, though, and the kids love it.
Bought this for my 10 year old for Christmas.  She screamed with excitement when she opened it.  Exactly as shown online.
I bought this camera for my 12 year old daughter, and she absolutely loves it. It is so easy to load, the pictures are clear and are a great size to make a collage out of.
This was a Christmas gift for my 11yo sister.  All of us older sisters played with it a lot more than her.  Definitely a favorite.
Absolutely flawless items and service! Easy to use. Wish the photos were a bit bigger but the quality was good.
Bought this for a 17 year old girl who had no clue how awesome Polaroids are. No filter needed and so much fun. Giant hit! Purchased an extra case of film and photo album to go along with it. Perfect gift for anyone over 10
Omg it was amazing great delivery came in,in two days I'm EXTREMLY satisfied
My daughter loves this camera!
Love the color and the size of the photos.
Such a cute camera to carry around !!It takes out great business card size pictures that takes about 10 minutes to fully appear - but slowly starts appearing after 2. The Fugifilm Instax mini is a fun camera to have, especially now when everyone is so used to taking pictures on their phones. Having the picture to print out instantly makes it exciting to get creative with it.
LOVE IT!  Works great!
Awesome little camera!
Excellent Product, Excellent Price, Shipped very quickly! WDBA! A+++
Wow this is a piece of junk!!I bought one for my teenage niece, she loves it. I bought one for myself - hate it. The quality is so poor - slightly better then the original Polaroid camera.I guess you really have to be under 20 to like this camera.
Bought this for my 12 and 7 year old nieces.  The girls were very happy!
I bought this for me, and I love it.  Very small picture but for me it's ok
Gift for my niece, she loved it!
Wonderful product.  My daughter loves it .
Awesome
My 11 year old loves this.  Works well right out of the box - easy to use.
Exactly How I Wanted It
What a fun camera! Bought for my 13 year old daughter and she has had tons of fun with it. Great gift for a teen!
This camera is pretty straightforward to operate and the photos develop like the ol' Kodak used to in the past. It's pretty fun and looks good too even indoors with less light. The viewfinder wasn't very accurate with showing what was actually in frame so you may need to play with framing at first to get the hang of it but overall it's a fun camera!
our picture are coming out white.
Perfect for parties. Love this camera!Be sure to choose the proper setting when taking pics so your photos don't get over exposed like ours did- see photo.I've used this for two parties for a make shift "photo booth" and now on vacation. Everyone loves it, it's super easy to use. The only downfall is how expensive film is :( either way, I'll pay it.Another idea we did- wrote Merry Christmas cards from Hawaii, snapped a photo, put it in the envelope and sent it to family. A cheap way of doing personalized family holiday pictures!
This camera is fun to use!
My grandchildren bought this for me for Christmas, it is a good on the go camera with good results.Takes a bit if getting used to & you don't get crystal clear pictures,what you do get are great Polaroids & lots of fun.
I love the Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Camera! I just got mine today. Make sure you buy film with the camera because it does not come with it. I couldn't be happier with this product!
This item didn't come with instructions in English. Also, the photo makes you think that film come with the camera and it does not.
This camera is Honestly Great! The ONLY down side is at night when its pitch black and Bright in the day it's a 50/50 chance it'll turn out at All:/ as long as you're Not facing the sun when you take the pic you're okk! Which I didn't know when I attempted to retake a pic like 3 times and they Didn't turn out at All. Besides that the pics are Very rustic and Great:)
Great camera! Very nice quality pics! My daughter loves it!
On time, the camera is perfect !
Happy with camera.
Every single photo we took from an expensive $20 fujifilm roll was either over or under exposed and completely useless.We had high hopes but no matter what setting we choose or what lighting we had the camera failed miserably and now we cannot recapture 20 Christmas morning memories.What a shame. We will try Polaroid next or any other brand
Came in good time and great shape. Looks exactly like the picture. I will tell you it is very cheap looking, most people think I have a child's play camera but what do you expect when you're buying a yellow polaroid? Great product, I love it!
I absolutely love this camera. I'm going to Orlando Florida, Guatemala, and Canada this year and really want to capture those moments and I've recently used it for Thanksgiving and Christmas so it is a really nice small gift to my family!
Cute mondern redition on the old instant camera. Pricey, and figure about a $1 per picture, but something different.
Christmas gift for 10 year old daughter, who wanted a camera. I thought she and her friends would enjoy seeing their photos come right out. Even the grown ups were intrigued. It's been a hit. Hopefully she won't go overboard on taking photos since the film runs around 75 cents to $1 per photo.
Awesome!
This is an adorable, affordable buy. I would pay extra, if you could choose which pictures I could print.
My granddaughter loves this camera! It brought back memories of the old polaroid instant camera which we still have. The film is somewhat expensive and the finished photos are very small.
Bought this for my 13 yr old,  she absolutely loves it! Was a great gift.
Little larger then we expect other wise great.Haven't use yet will post another review later
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas...the idea was great but wasted a whole pack of film trying to get it to work.  Would only print out every other pic and then it put two photos together.  Gonna return asap. Very disappointed!!!
My 13 year old daughter loves this
My granddaughter loved this camera.  Best gift.  Love it
Very compact and works great so far!!  The film is a little pricey, though.  Less room for mistakes...
Cute little camera but wish the films were bigger.
Daughter absolutely loves it.  Shipping time was awesome.
My first Polaroid camera ever so I didn't know what to expect. It was super easy to use and super cute. The picture quality is not the best but I'm assuming is typical for a Polaroid. I do love having them instantly though. Absolutely love it.
Love it !
All instructions are in Chinese and does not come w the film and when we bought the film it does not work
Ruined Christmas.  The camera does not work.
The box of this product says it includes film for 10 pictures. Ours did not. What a disappointment for our daughter who got this on Christmas Day and couldn't take any pictures. Very upsetting. Santa would have bought film had he known.
This doesn't take pictures that you can actually make out!  Blurry and dark!!
Bought this for my daughter as a birthday gift.  She absolutely loves it.  Takes great pictures and a fun way to create memories for a scrapbook.  Only downside is the film is a little pricey.
Nice looking camera, Bit heavy but nothing too bad. Does not come with film so if you are going to buy it, Buy film with it. Also the instructions do not come in English, Which is very annoying. Aside from that, It was worth buying.
DID NOT LIKE THE PHOTOS HAD TO RETURN IT
very good camera . It works well and looks great .
Bought this as a birthday present for my mother. She hasn't used it yet but she's excited to use it. Too bad the film is the size of a credit card, and not like the size of the vintage Polaroids.
Such a fun camera.  My daughter loves it.
Love the photos that I get to take with this! Great item, arrived in perfect condition.
Works great! Bought it for my kid to take pictures with friends. She loves it and it's great for making little memories!
Got my camera--along with some film I bought with it--last Friday, and ever since Sunday, the little light indicating the mode you're on, is stuck on the first/home mode. Even when I clearly set the camera to a different lighting/mode, the light stays on home. So whenever I take a picture, it doesn't come out in the brightness I want. I changed the batteries, thinking it was just a problem with the batteries. Nope. I can still use the camera, I guess, if I want pictures that don't come out how I want. I'm not sure if I can get a refund or not, so I'm screwed. It was nice while it lasted, 2 days.
This camera is so fun. My 11 year old loves it and takes it everywhere. It actually takes nice pics and so fun to get them instantly. Everybody is always asking about it when they see her using it!
Very nice and cute. Good for the price. This was my daughter's birthday gift and she loved it. It takes good clear pictures.
perfect for christmas
Everything looks like it is in fine shape.  My granddaughter's Christmas present - will let you know how she likes it.
Purchased for a gift and it was a wonderful price. Item arrived just as described
Good to see a form of Polaroid come back. At least for me. Got for my daughter in law. She'll love it as it's instant. I also purchased tripod to go w it. Got christmas
I love my camera so much it's so nice ! Great quality ! I was skeptical at first but honestly it was worth the money.
This camera takes horrible pictures.  Do not buy!!!
After a few month of gentle use the shutter to the lens will not close anymore. Once the lens got dirt in it the picture quality has been severely compromised. Will be returning this. Also spent a lot of money getting the films, which will have to be returned as well.
no problems
Great Camera. Good quality of pictures even with flash. Kids are very happy to see the picture develop.
Great value
i love this product. my only complaint that i wish the photos were bigger. just my preference. it is ok.
Yes received my order and was happy with it. My granddaughter is going to love it.
came in excellent condition these cameras a lot of fun for any of us who remember being burdened by film : )
It's really cool but it didn't come with film.
Very cute, and fun too have.  Pictures come out a bit duller than expected, and for the price of the film you should get more and better quality.
recieved as shown with batteries and when expected.
great
It's fun.. Takes really cute small clear instant photos which is great in a digital would for my daughter to have a memory to hold...film is hard to find.. I started ordering on line.  Same price 2 dollars a photo worth it to me I love photographs that much.
Perfect, thanks!
so good
Do Not by this from professional depot I bought two cameras and thought the film was the defective item but it was the camera because I have ordered 20 rolls of film from different places and they are all defective so it has to be the camera. Wish I could get one that actually worked :(
I bought this camera as a birthday gift for my daughter. We used it once (one roll of film). Like any other good present she didn't try to use it again for several months! We were surprised to find that it would no longer take photos.
Good camera with photos printed so quick!
Lots of fun, my daughter loves it, pretty color blue! works just like they used too.
It came a little late but otherwise I love it!
I was very disappointed in the box the camera came in. It looked like it had been chewed by a dog and was dented in on one side. This was going to be a gift from Santa and the box looks horrible. When I opened the package there was no packing stuff to help the camera stay safe during shipping. I hope when my child gets this camera it wasn't banged around so much that it doesn't work.
everything that was described
Received and wrapped for Christmas.
I FINALLY GOT THE CAMERA THANK YOU
So far this camera does exactly as I had hoped! It brings back warm and fuzzy memories of my childhood! I gave 3 stars due to the packaging. It came extremely roughed up. I was disappointed!
I wanted to try this out.  I have two awesome cameras, both digital that take great pics.  I chose this camera just for fun family events, throw back type photos that you can take and have instant gratification, pass out as keepsakes, etc.  Let me start by saying, like other reviewers comments on other sellers sites here selling this camera, they advertise a selfie mirror, NO, there is NOT a selfie mirror.  Slight disappointment but no biggie I guess.  Let me finish by saying, its a great camera for a 7 year old.  Its basic, doesnt do anything except snap & print a tee-tiny little picture that I must say, you can barely even see some things you are photographing.  Overall, I feel silly using this camera.  I guess its fun at first, but the lack of its ability to really do anything makes it a big disappointment.  For the steep price and the overexaggerated marketing, this product is a fail.  I expected old time polaroid type photos, it does NOT deliver.  Positive: As always Amazon delivered within 1 business day.
this is so adorable and i love the pics. if your into the whole vintage thing you will love this!
Nice camera.
This is a novelty product and is not worth the money.  The film is ridiculously expensive, the photos are tiny and your kid will be interested in it for about 4 minutes.  Too bad they don't make them like they used to.
christmas present
AWESOMMEEEEEEE
Brought it for my daughter's birthday, it's a cute starter camera, she loves it!
My daughter love it, Great product
Glot this and all the accessories for my granddaughter for Christmas. She does not have it yet but I am sure she will like it....it was on her list to me submitted before Thanksgiving...LOL
Color is pretty much red doesn't even have a hint of pink in it
gi o d
This camera is awesome. Classic looking photos and easy to use.
Purchased this for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it.  Apparently instant cameras are a fad right now and this seems to work well. It's simple to use and is a fun novelty item.And it IS a novelty item.  Please don't buy this thinking you're getting something that's going to take amazing photos. They quality is just lovely for a Polaroid-style camera, but you won't get the results that you get from your phone or digital camera.  This is designed for kids to take cute pictures of their friends, not something you're going to take vacation photos with. My daughter decorates them with stickers, writes on them with her friends and hangs them in her study and bedroom on ribbons with tiny clothespins.The photos are about the size of a credit card or wallet-sized photo, including the white frame around the picture. Big difference between this and the old square Polaroids from our childhood is that you *don't* flap these in the air to develop them.. That will actually hurt the development process. You lay the film on a flat surface and it takes about 10 minutes to finish processing.It's an instant camera, so it's bulky compared to a regular one, but again, you're not going to want to take this to document a family trip.The bulk and the price of the film (roughly $1 per picture) would keep me from giving this to a child younger than 10-12.  I would definitely not purchase this for a little one, because they'd go through $20 in film in eleven seconds and you'd have a lot of blurry photos of their feet and the walls!Now for a bunch of 15 year old girls, it's a lot of fun and my daughter and her friends have really enjoyed it.
Love this! I bought the Fujifilm Insta Mini to use in home-made photo booth at my mom's bday celebration. People loved the idea and were able to leave a short message for my mom at the bottom of the photo.  Then I collected all the pics and created a mini photo album with the pics. Overall I got my money worth. See the pics below.
Very fun little product, great holiday gift.  Pics are what you'd expect. Fun to have as a retro response to digital phone pics. Don't forget the two AA batteries if you're giving it as a gift.
I always love these cameras! I bought the older model for myself and fell in love with it so I got this one for my sisters birthday. It's so perfect for when she wants to take pictures to put up in her college dorm! Don't forget the film
My daughter loved this gift for her birthday.
I'm happy with this purchase, product was well packaged and it arrived in a timely manner. I love the camera, we had fun taking pictures during Thanksgiving, great conversation piece.  The camera takes great pictures as well.
Love this little camera. It's very fun to play with and get instant prints. The film is a bit pricey, so be warned if you plan on being really crazy with the photos. It ends up being approx. 1$ per photo. Also, the picture makes the camera seem more pink, but it is a little more orange. It doesn't look bad, but it is not quite as pink as you would expect and I was a little surprised. I will say I was disappointed in that it didn't come with even one thing of film, which is troublesome when your film is in a different order, so I had to wait to use it.
So much fun!! Ordered this for my husbands youth group and the teens love it. Takes really cool vintage photos. This is the mini version so photos aren't the big typical ones but that works for us. I have noticed you need to get fairly close to your subject and have somewhat decent lighting for pictures to show up well. It's best for up close face pictures. Really happy with this purchase and love the blue color!
I love my camera it's the best thing ever !!
Nice
good
Excelente
Nice product, great for tween's, teens and parties.
Better than expected! I was worry that doesn't work as supposed to... But works perfectly!
i think it's a cute idea to bring back the polaroid camera in a new fun design.  I like it but I wouldn't say I love it.  The picture quality isn't there which is what i expected but the camera sometimes pauses for too long before it takes the picture which usually results in a bit of a blurry picture.  And with the film being as expensive as it is, it is a bit frustrating to have blurry pictures.  Overall, though, I like the camera.  I'm happy that I made the purchase.
Great price!! Delivered fast. Product as described!!
I love my mini camera! My only complaint was that this product advertised the front mirror, but mine never came with it..
its so cute, im so glad i got my wife this color she loves it
If you are thinking of buying this product, do it because this camera is the perfect size to fit in any bag and you can't beat the price.  However film may be expensive but you are paying for cool looking vintage photos. Definitely recommend! ☺️
I love love love this camera.  It is fun for snapshots. I love the pale pink color. People of all ages will enjoy this camera, but maybe youngsters especially.  I am 43 and I am having a blast with this camera.  I have taken photos of my whole family and decorated them with stickers.  A great hobby.
In love with this camera. It' has some tricks you should have on mine like to be sure to set the light exposition, cause otherwise it could turn too bright or too dark. Also, it leaves a big spaces between the top of what you see through the lense and the photo print. I mean, when you're shooting to someone's head. if you put the top of the view on their head, the printed photo will come out with lot of space above the head. If you just want a portrait from neck to head (for example), then you would set the view to just see from the forehead and down. This way, then the photo would just cover from the top hair down without leaving a big black space...
CUTEST CAMERA EVER. used it for our photo guest book at our wedding and received tons of compliments.
LOVE THIS SO MUCH. GREAT PRODUCT.
Awesome camera!!it takeS great pictures very fun and easy to use . the raspberry color is more of a red then pink  but still very cute:) my husband got it for me and I can't stop snapping pics: )looove it!
Not sure if it works yet, because it's a Christmas gift, but looks intact.  There are a few more scratches on the back that I wasn't expecting.  The gift is for my daughter and she knows I shop Amazon.  If it was for anyone else, I would be concerned that it looked too used to give as a gift.
My 13 yo got this for her bday. She loves it. It took her a little while but once she (finally) read the instructions she was happily snapping away
Perfect
the pictures are pretty blurry.
Came on time and works well! Exactly as pictured.
I absolutely love this camera. It is perfect for any occasion. Worth the money!
This was the rave of our party! Everyone just wanted to take pictures with it.
My son took 4 pictures and then it stopped working.  it was never dropped.  we insterted a new pack of film and it still didn't work.  ridiculously bad and now we own 5 packs of film for a camera that doesn't work.
I have yet to use the camera as it's for my daughter's birthday but it looks perfect! Not to mention the price was unbeatable! This sameCamera at Michaels is more than double the price!
This camera is great! I don't know why I thought it would be bigger, but I love how small it is! The camera it self is beautiful and simple to use. The photos come out nice as well.
Absolutely love this camera!!  This camera is very stylish and cute all in a very great way. This lovely camera came with two batteries a strap.Just a reminderthis camera does not come with film. It weighs more than I expected but it doesn't weigh enough to hurt your arm. You should defanantley but this camera it is suck good quality for that price hope you guys enjoy your cameras and they would make very great christmas presents💓
I bought this as a gift, but the tags expired on my car in july and i barely got them updated
Absolutely love this camera! An updated version of what most of us grew up with. Shipping was even quicker than the seller had promised!
Inexpensive and fun way to capture memories. Bought 2, one for each daughter after used at son's wedding.
This was a gift for my great grandaughter, she is pretty young but mom supervises her. They love the camera!
Makes mediocre-at-best photos but it's fairly compact (at least compared to the old Poloroids my generation is familiar with) and my daughter had to have one.  Guess they're cool again. Who knew!
came in great condition & packaged well. I bought this as a gift for a friend, I think she'll really enjoy it.
Terrific product at a great price.
I always get so many compliments on this camera! I have been offered to take pictures and have them purchased by strangers. These pictures come out GREAT! The best part is you instantly have your picture physically in your hands once it is taken. Now a days hardly anyone prints pictures anymore, yet these memories are so priceless! I love my camera so much I bought one for my niece too. It is a great camera with good quality pictures and memories for keepsake!
Love this cutey. Cute color and perfect for a quick album :). Image size is credit card size though.
My daughter loves it
Love the color ~ it's so fun to use! My daughter and her friends are having a great time with it!
This camera is so affordable and it's so cute! The photos are teeny tiny - wish they were bigger we always take this on trips in addition to our dslr - it's fun and retro.
:)

Small and takes cute pictures
If it weren't so expensive, it would get 5 stars.  Love this camera for a fun twist at parties and school events. Used it at an end of the year Kindergarten celebration and the kids couldn't get enough. Too bad film is so expensive! The kids had fun taking pictures of each other and trading them with one another.  Got the idea of buying this camera at a wedding where they used this for their guest book with props, etc. Definitely a hit for all ages!
Best purchase I believe I have ever made.
I love this camera! Not just for kids! Im a 25 year old wife and mother of two (ages 2 & 1) and i used this camera on our first cross country roadtrip and every holiday since purchasing it! It is a geeat way to keep those memories in a physical form!
This thing is super cool! I love taking it around and taking pictures with it, but I think mine came with a malfunction. Since I received it in the mail and started using it I realized that the lighting wheel didn't work.. It stayed on the same lighting. Other than that this is a super cute and fun way to take pictures!
Nice
I love this! It's so much fun!
This was a gift. I hit the mark with this one.  Takes great pix and you have them in a couple of minutes.
So far so good...this item is a Christmas gift. I did open to look at it and it seems pretty neat, looks easy to use as well!
just what I wanted. Described perfectly.
so cute.
This is such a fun camera! I'm able to take a picture and get it instantly. I love having this to document pictures of events and be able to give them to the person right there. It's also been fun having it to take pictures of my baby and I can write the date on the front. You do, however, need to put the picture in a dark spot (in a book or something) until it's developed. It makes the pictures turn out better.
So happy I got the camera here. Great quality for a great price!
got this for my 11yo as a gift.  Really cool color and fun.  Easy to use, love it!!
Described perfectly. Everything I expected:)
I really enjoyed this camera. But I really hated not seeing what I was getting before it was printed out. I went on vacation and it was quite sunny and half the pictures didn't show up because of that, no matter what setting I used. All the indoor pictures and afternoon pictures were okay! There is an adapter that allows you to take selfies. It's a cute idea!
I like it
Hard to work.
So I have been wanting this camera for years!!! And I finally had enough money to get this plus the accessories! And I'm so in love!!
This thing is awesome
My item came in good shape and it worked perfectly
loved it
Easy & Smart
Great product and line by FujiFilm. Small and compact, easy to carry as well as very light!
My daughter is going to have a great Christmas!!!!!
This is such a fun cute camera! Each picture has a vintage feel to it, which I love. It's so easy too, just press the button near the lens,and it starts right up! The only bad part is having to buy more film, but it isn't very expensive. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who likes vintage things.
Was very pleased with it although when I try to take pictures at night it does not show up at all. Idk if I used the wrong setting but yea.
A bit flimsy and cheap.  Pictures turn out either too dark or too light. Bummed 😔. I small child would enjoy this but would be expensive to refill photos!
Fall in love with random life photos again!! My Border Collie is terrified of it! lol lol!
Excellent transaction, highly recommended
It's perfect I love it.
It's a great purchase, it comes complete and nothing is missing. Excellent conditions, I love it!
I love it works just fine great quilts picture
I bought this instax mini 8 from Amazon directly (not another dealer through Amazon). It works wonderfully and came in its complete package. I absolutely love it!
gave it to a friend and he loved it
I love it,beautiful picture but it does get expensive with all the picture but overall I think its a great product
It's really good. It worked for me for almost 6 months. it would work longer, however I took it to the beach and I guess sand got stuck in it and they don't offer a warranty.
I love this thing, it shipped really fast and it was an amazing birthday gift to myself.
This is my favorite little toy. It is so much fun to bring to the beach, on a hike, or on a trip to the city. It is durable, but not heavy or too clunky. The style is unique and minimal. Set up is quick, operation is entirely simple.This would make such a wonderful holiday or birthday present.
Daughter wanted this and loves it.  the photo's are about wallet style - she loves that!
Beautiful photos. This is the second mini we've bought hoping it was just a fluke. Broke after two photos. All the red lights flashed and wouldn't load.
Amazing!
In lovvveee with this camera! worth the money for sure. They best part is having a cute keep sake to put up in your room.
I love it. I took it to Miami and got some great pictures. It's not too big or small and the pictures are about the size of a credit card. I got one camera and it was defective but contacted the seller within the following week I had it replaced I was so pleased. They even paid for me to send them back the broken one. The replacement I got was perfect worked well!
This is a really great and easy to use camera. I love the color and the design. I wanted to get a camera that would be easy enough for my grandmother to use, and it is! Shipping was fast and looks exactly like the picture shown.
my 10 yr old daughter loves it!!!!!!!
so fun and easy! nice to have ease of use and instant gratification in lieu of a digitally complex world
I love it!!! It's smaller than I expected but it's still a good size.But my complaints are that I put film in the camera but didn't change the number of how much I got also it feels cheap.
Great little camera, however the film is just as expensive!
I bought this to use at a photo booth at my daughter's Sweet 16 party. It was the hit of the party. The pictures were great. I dont think the kids put it down all night.  Highly recommend this camera. The pictures are small but it was worth every dime for the fun it brought the party.
GREAT PICTURES AND MY GIRLFRIEND LOVES THE QUALITY, BETTER THAN THE POLAROID I BOUGHT HER EARLIER THIS YEAR.
Absolutely love my Instax.  I take it on vacations with me and to outings with my friends and family.  I have never been disappointed with a shot unless I put it on the wrong setting.  Definitely would recommend this no matter what color you buy.  I bought this one because it was the cheapest color at the time - but I fell in love with the color once I had it in my hand.
I bought this for my daughters for Christmas last year and they absolutely love it! The pictures come out clear, it is very simple to use, and it's fun for kids!
Total disappointment! The color "Raspberry" is pretty on the website and on the box the camera comes in but the camera itself is more like a burnt orange color!!
This is listed as the fujifilm camera with a selfie mirror (notice the tiny mirror next to the lense) and so you would assume any third party sellers listing their items as this would be identical. However, it's just the normal fujifilm camera. Not bad, but I wish it came as described.
Quick shipping. LOVE THIS CAMERA I AM OBSSESED!!! Made my aunt cry forHer birthday when she received photos that were printed right then and there. And it actually has a very wide range! Fits a lot of people! Love love love!
This was a big hit at my wedding. I love it! The color is so cute!
This is the first polaroid camera I have ever bought and it was so worth it. It's so cute and portable, not only do I get vintage inspired films from this I get to have the pictures almost instantly. So much worth the buy, now I can account on all my events to be captured into pictures.
I bought it as a birthday gift for my 15 year old granddaughter and she absolutely loves it.  My only concern might be that the price of the film is a little on the high priced end.  But all in all - it was a huge hit with her.
perfect! exactly what i wanted! just wish film wasn't so expensive!
Never got it to work.I'm really really iupset because I've replaced the batteries multiple times, followed the directions and have tried multiple different film cartridges but it never turned on!
cant wait to take pics
Love this little toy. Bought this for my gf as a gift and she loved it. The picture quality is good as a polarized camera. No other complains. Satisfied!
Love it ! Great Conditions!
Love it! Takes amazing pictures
So I purchased this camera since it looked cool. But when I received it the camera would not turn on even with the compatible film. Then I bought a second one in pink, the film exploded with ink. What a horrible product. Rip off, don't buy.
Easy to use. Automatic lighting sensor tells you which of the 4 settings to use. Love it!
Adorable fun camera! Works great and speedy shipping!
Fast shipping, got here a day before than expected. Really amazing price too, will definitely come back here if I ever buy another.
BEST camera ever! It's a cool new instant camera, and it works like a charm!  There isn't anything that I would say bad about it!
I'm not sure how I feel about this item. It came in very dirty, red stains along the front cover of where you put the film. Some type of ink dark black stain near the top of the camera. A little bit of brown stains. Poorly packaged, everything was just stuffed in there along with user manual and guide.  was buying this as a gift hoping the box was at least decent looking. But then again it was clearly stated that the box wasn't looking new I give them that. But over all I feel as if the box was more discriptive it's self than the actual product.
I thought I would use this camera all the time.  I was afraid of the cost of the film because of how much I was going to use it... nope.  It's a great idea for young children or for a party.  Not so much if you're a grown adult that has a job and can afford a real camera or if you own a smartphone.The picture quality is ok.  It's reminiscent of the old style poloroids from the 80s.  The thing is that like movies and tv, cameras have gotten better.  Much much better.  So don't be shocked if you can't really make out the details of a picture you took of your kids 20 feet away.Also take a look at the size of the pictures.  It's a lot smaller than the old style poloroids about half the size.This being said.  My children really like this camera.  I think because they were born to a time where we have automatic sensor lights in our house and Amazon's Echo tells us answers to whatever we ask it.  They have no idea what a land line phone is and TV has always been high def.  So a poloroid camera is a novelty and the manual process of producing a picture is like magic to them.  They can have a picture on paper (and not on the camera where they live).  I can see kids up to 12 really getting a kick out of this.  So the kid in me is giving this 4 stars.  If you have money to burn then buy this product.
Good one
100 %Satisfied
Great camera for my 5 yr old girl, who had wanted instant camera for a while now. She loved taking pictures AND getting the prints right away, as opposed to all the digital stuff we have. Word of a caution: be sure to let your kid know NOT to open the back of the camera where the film goes. My kid opened and wasted the full film pack (she actually took out the whole pack, and removed each film, one by one). And those things are not cheap :).Overall I'm happy with the purchase. It's much better present (I wouldnt call that a toy, as it has an actual use) than all other disney crap she wants. While camera is relatively not expensive, the films are, so keep this in mind. (Gillette using guys will know what I'm talking about ;))
Love this camera! It's not only super cute, but it's so much fun to use. I loved my Polaroid camera when I was a kid so I'm glad Fuji made this. It's a fun camera to use.
Love love it!! Wish I would have bought this a long time ago it's so much fun!
button to take pictures - broken.  replaced it with store bought instead of waiting for a replacement.
Exactly what I was looking for!
Works great! My girlfriend loves it and the pictures turn out really good. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because of the price of the film. Other than that is a fun little camera.
This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter which I know she will love.  Her favorite color is pink!!!
Great
I find that it only takes good photos indoors, with proper lighting, and u need to be at least 3 feet away from the subject. No matter what the setting is on, outdoor photos in bright light turn out completely white. Very disappointed.
It is adorable first of all. It also brings a bit of nostalgia to me from growing up in the 90's. This camera is a hit where ever I go, people always ask me where I bought it. I have since moved on to the instax 300 wide camera but this camera will always have a special place in my heart.
Great Gift for my Daughter
I am IN LOVE with this camera!  It's really cool, feels good in the hands, and takes pretty good pictures. The only downside is the cost of film, and how long it takes to ship. Overall I would really recomend getting this Fujifilm instax mini 8.  '''
No problems at all! Loved the color! The package arrived safely and on time.
Looks wonderful! Arrived here faster than states. Couldn't ship film so I will need to hunt some down.
LOVE
Got this for my daughter and she loves it!!  She also got the film.  The pictures are smaller than the Polaroid pictures.  The camera is very easy to use.  Great item that teen girls love!!
lots of fun
I absolutely  love this camera that only downside is the price of film. I can't  wait to use it for holiday parties along with same photo booth props.
My daughter really enjoys it. I think it's a huge waste of money.
It broke after having it for one week. Pictures for stuck and wouldn't come out. So disappointed.
Love the colors of the photos coming out of it. manages to get everyone excited to see how the photo came out. The eye lens shows a smaller farm then the photos when they come out, a bit annoying in group pics.
Excellent camera. The kids had a great time with this. Photos are small, but capture everything perfectly.
I'm only giving this three stars, because it was broken when I received it. It did not take pictures and would keep flashing. I've taken out the batteries and put in new ones, still nothing. I went and got one from Target instead and it works fine, so I will be returning the one I got from Amazon. Probably just had bad luck, but I do like the camera overall (I would have given it 5/5 if the one I received actually worked)
Oh my gosh! I love this camera, I'm taking it with me everywhere!!! I bought 50 sheets of film but I honestly don't think it's enough haha! Probably going to buy a lot more next paycheck! Love this camera, the pictures are small but they are really cute, the pictures take about less than 3 minutes to fully process, this camera is adorable and so worth it! Considering they sell these for way more! My package came perfectly, nothing wrong with it, came with batteries, it did take a while for it to come though but it was worth the wait!
Great gift
Great item
Thanks its very good and the delivery fast
Great
Love it
Excelent product
My daughter purchase this for her birthday and i believe its a perfect little gift for a 12 year old, its super fun to take when she is hanging out with her friend. Perfect memories. She put them on the back of her case or on her walls.
I love this camera!!! I traveled all over Europe and took tons of photos.
More red, then magenta but that was what I was wanting so its perfect!
In a word? Obsessed.Ever since I got this camera in late September, I have brought it to several parties, as well as cons. Whenever I bring it, everyone always wants to take home the images. So I have to be judicious with who gets to take  a picture, otherwise I'm spending money on film I never see. I read other reviews about how popular the camera was with friends and family, and I can contest that it really is. People are surprised when they see it, and then curious about the lineage of how instant cameras have progressed to this point of small and compact size. I can't even tell you how many people have asked me where I've gotten it at this point.My entire reason for getting it was to take it to AWA to snap pictures of people in costumes, and have a physical representation of the convention experience. And because I have somewhat of a type-A personality, I did extensive research on multiple models over the course of several days. This is something I learned early on: every single person will call it a Polaroid. Not a single one knows to call it an Instax, even after finding out that’s what it is. Kind of interesting how much the Polaroid brand has withstood the test of time, like how people say Kleenex instead of tissue. Anyways... These Pros/Cons were taken before the purchase of the camera, and were generally what other people said over several platforms (Amazon, FujiFilm website, other blog posts). At the time of purchase, I got this model for 67.98, which was in line with all the other colors. Because it’s a popular color, it looks like they’ve upped the price.In case you aren’t looking to comparisons and you just want to know why I chose this model, I ended up deciding on the 8 for several reasons. While the cameras from 25 and beyond have a button feature for horizontal and vertical, the 8 doesn’t. I am completely fine with tilting the camera either way, and I have never had an issue taking vertical shots. The 8 also has a price point and purpose I think agree with each other. For less than $70, I could get an instant camera to take to parties and conventions, a camera I could also use for when I have a Photobooth set up at my parties (something I do a lot). And the final deciding factor was the color and design. The 8 comes in a variety of colors, including the beautiful pastel blueishgreen I decided on. While some people thought the design looked cheesy and cheap, I really loved it! I liked the lightweight feel and compact size and the cute sort of toy look of it appealed to my nostalgic side.By far, the best camera is the 90. It offers an option to turn the flash on/off, which I could say is the biggest caveat of all of the other cameras in this series. Because the flash is always on the 8, it washes out pictures taken in bright light. I’ve mostly used the 8 inside and at parties, ant it performs very well in that environment.At any rate, here are my findings:FujiFilm Instax 210 Instant Wide (camera priced at $72.89 as of 11/11, $15.99 for 20 exposures)Note: Takes 4 AA batteries.PROS:-Better at outdoor images than smaller Instax cameras, because they show more detail.-Larger photo size, about 2x bigger than the mini.-More like a classic Polaroid from the ‘90s, so it has a really nice nostalgia factor.-Has 3 different camera modes: lighten, darken, and normal.-Tends to look best with a horizontal shot, but you can turn the camera for a vertical shot.CONS:-Bulky, not easy to carry in a pocket or small purse.-Auto flash.-Not conducive to traveling, due to its large size.-Fragile construction.Recommended for: Anyone who wants more of a classic Polaroid feel, with larger images.____FujiFilm Instax Mini 8 (camera priced at $67.49 – 72.00 as of 11/11, $15 for 20 exposures)Note: Takes 2 4AA batteries.Note: Just because this camera doesn’t offer an option for horizontal and vertical images does not mean you can’t simply tilt the camera, because you definitely can!PROS:-Small photo size, about the size of a business card.-Portable and easy to travel with.-Takes good indoor/outdoor photos.-Camera itself is available in many colors.-Cute design.-Sturdy construction.- Has 4 settings: indoor, cloudy, little sun, sunny.CONS:-Small photo size (both a pro and con).-Easy to over and underexpose film.-Jamming film problem with some people. (though I haven’t had this issue yet)-No zoom function. You get one lens, and that’s all. (A close up lens is sold separately, however.)-Auto flash.-Looks like a toy. Some people said they didn’t like the look and considered it “cheap”.Recommended for: Casual use: weddings, parties, get-togethers.___FujiFilm Instax 25 Mini (camera priced at $84.13 as of 11/11, $15 for 20 exposures)Note: Comes with 2 CR2 batteries.PROS:-Small photo size.-Self-portrait mirror for those of you who want an “old school selfie”.-Smaller and lighter than the 8 because it doesn’t use the AA batteries that 8 uses.-Portable and easy to travel with.-Cute-sy design.-Comes with a close-up macro lens.-An option for horizontal and vertical images.-Lighten/darken image mode or turn on flash.-Takes good indoor/outdoor photos.CONS:-Small photo size (both a pro and con).-Limited color selection.-Doesn’t take very good nighttime shots.-Auto flash.Recommended for: Casual use: weddings, parties, get-togethers. Those that want to take “selfies”.____FujiFilm Instax 50S Mini (camera priced at $90.99 as of 11/11, $15 for 20 exposures)Note: Comes with 2 CR2 batteries.PROS:-Small photo size.-Self-timer.-Comes with a close-up macro lens.-Good in low light.-An option for horizontal and vertical images.-Sleek, more of an adult look to it.-3 settings: Auto, Fill-in Flash, and Landscape. Also has a light/dark function.CONS:-Small photo size (both a pro and con).-Auto flash.-Tendency to overexpose, especially when it’s overcast.Recommended for: Casual use, and those that like the option of taking close-up pictures.____FujiFilm Instax Mini 90 (camera priced at $137.49 – 140.49, $15 for 20 exposures)Note: Comes with rechargeable battery and wall charger.PROS:-Small photo size.-Sleek, more of a retro look to it.-Sturdy construction.-An option for horizontal and vertical images.-An option to turn the flash on/off.-Can adjust brightness.-Special nighttime option makes it great for lower light.-Self-timer.-Much less bulk and weight than other Instax cameras.-Good for travel and very portable.-Takes great day and nighttime shots.-Digital display tells you how much film you have left.-Macro mode for closer images.-Has 4 settings.CONS:-Small photo size (both a pro and con).-Much more expensive than other Instax models: you definitely pay for the looks and additional features.Recommended for: More serious photographers.----UPDATED REVIEW, 1 YEAR AFTER PURCHASE AND USE---I still love this camera, even a year later. I've taken it with me to NYC, to countless parties, to conventions, and just regular ole days out on the town. Here are a few observations over the year:-It sucks in light. Like really really sucks. It always washes images out, and sometimes that creates a cool effect, but for the most part it just looks bad. I really wish there was a way to turn off the flash, but since there isn't this camera is best inside.-It only sort of eats up batteries. It will start flashing when it's low, but I've been able to take somewhere between 20-30 additional photos after it has started flashing. Just make sure that you only turn it on when you're ready to take a shot, and not spending forever waiting for your friends to get into a decent formation.-It is pretty bulky (but not heavy) for travel purposes. It takes up a lot of precious space in suitcases or backpacks, so be prepared to sacrifice the loss of a few items of clothing for it.-It can take a little bit of a beating. In my suitcase, jostled with shoes, clothes, and books, it has done fine. It's also done well when I put it in a little bag I have with extra batteries that are loose and jiggling around and knocking into it.-It still works swimmingly for me. I've never experienced any issues with jamming or any other issues, really.-And one final tip. It's probably best to buy an extra 10-20 rolls for parties, because people will REALLY REALLY want to take the pictures home.
I love this camera.  I bought it on a whim and it has been so fun to bring to parties and dinners.  My only negative is that the instructions are nearly impossible to read and the film is a little expensive.  But I still love it.
I LOVE THIS CAMERA....need I say more?
Great for parties. Everyone loves it.
MY GRAND-DAUGHTER WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT HER GIFT!!!
Really very fun camera!! very good quality of the photos!!!
My sister loves this! Definitely brings you back to the golden days and we love that you get the picture instantly! The pictures are clear and everything is extremely easy to use.
Gr daughter loved the blue camera. The blue mudder camera case fit the camera perfectly. She couldn't have been happier.
No selfie mirror as clearly stated - angered.
My daughter loves it. She's very happy with the camera.😀
I love this camera. I'd never been into photography (and still aren't that interested in it, to be honest!) but this camera makes me enjoy taking pictures very much. I carry it everywhere I go so thank goodness it's light weight. The only downside is that the film is quite expensive for how little you get in each box ($10-$12 for 10 sheets). Some of the reviews of this camera say that the pictures don't come out well, but I haven't had any problems with mine; the colours come in crisp (keep in mind that these pictures are supposed to look "vintage") and develop very quickly. I also saw some reviews saying how paper jamming is frequent, but I've had my camera for over a month and I've used it at least once almost every day since purchase, and mine hasn't jammed at all. I get so many compliments on how cute this camera is, so I definitely recommend it!
Perfect
My favorite camera ever! i ordered it in the color Raspberry and it's super cute (°◡°♡)
It's a great lil camera
I got the camera this past Thursday. It kept taking pictures in complete whiteness. I've adjusted the setting and everything. Even taken the batteries out and the polaroid film and still kept taking those white pictures.
Great to use for children's parties!  Instant photos for the kids - and you don't have to worry about getting any approval from parents as the kids take home their pics.  Love the "pink" color!  Easy to use...
I bought this camera for my daughter and she loves it! No issues to report yet. Although, I do think the product does seem a little fragile. Handle with care..
xmas gift
Great camera
My sister loved it ^_^ I bought it for her birthday.
I consider myself an intermediate photographer, and I found it so unfortunate that once I got into photography, Polaroids were a thing of the past. I was so stoked to learn that a new generation of instant camera is so present on the market now!I got my camera a few days ago and I've already gone through two packs of film. This is my new favorite thing!The controls are easy to understand, there's a little bit of a learning curve, but that's very small. Four shots, and this camera is now easy-peasy.I highly recommend this to novice and professional photographers a like. It's a fun little toy to have, and is well worth the price of the films.
Bought this as a gift for my friend and she loved it
I have ALWAYS wanted a camera like this & I love anything that comes in pink. This soft, light pink is so gorgeous & very close to the color of my bedroom. I'm so happy that this came with a wrist strap too. I almost ordered one separately, but glad I didn't. This camera is so easy to use & absolutely adorable. I'm getting tired of all my special moments being electronic, so I want moments I can keep forever. The strap can be put on either side, which is handy. It also has adjustments for each type of lighting. The photo shown was on a super dark, rainy day, so I was happy that our cat actually showed up & was of good quality. Overall, this is an amazing purchase & I couldn't be happier :)
This little camera is so much fun!! I had purchased it for photos while we travel. And ended up using it for our wedding. They aren't the higest quality but I think that's a bit of the charm!! Film is expensive but worth it if you can afford t for special trips and memories!
Very nice camera! I absolutely love it and I'm so glad i got it; I already took ten pictures with it!
I bought it for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it!!!!! Nice pictures and very fun!!!!!
super cute and easy to use camera
It is no longer working. Can i send it back???
Exactly what I was looking for.  I'd absolutely order again.  It was easy to use and easy to refill.
I bought this for my daughter's birthday.  It was a hit at the party.  It was something she really wanted and it works great.
Works great but the function in the lense to change the lighting is broken. Can't always trust the picture will turn out great because of this.
works greaaaaaat
love this camera!!
This was such a hit at my sister's wedding! The camera is great. Photo quality is great and the size is perfect for me. However, the photo paper is expensive if u use it a lot.
Got this as a present for my sister. She LOVES it. The pictures are super cute, it's very lightweight and portable, and the instructions are pretty clear.
As described
Great product. I use it all the time.
Granddaughters 11th birthday gift. Said it was her best birthday gift ever!
Color looks nothing like the photo. It's almost orange in color. We returned for the light pink one.
So much fun!! Bought this for a party and now my nephew thinks I'm magic because I have a camera that prints pictures automatically! And to think, this was just the norm a while back!
photos are the size of a credit card
So far great camera
perfect for my scrapbooking.  bought this one for my boyfriend's mother, who's also a scrapbooker
It doesn't really focus for up-close pictures, so I bought detachable selfie lens that supposedly fixes that. I haven't quite figured out how to use it yet because all the instructions are in Chinese. It comes with two AA batteries (appreciated) and a countdown to let you know how many shots are left. Wish it held more than 10 photos at a time! It supposedly has different settings for indoor versus outdoor photos, but for the life of me I cannot figure out if this can take photos without flash yet. The flash always seems to go off, which makes it hard to get photos if you're near any reflective surfaces. That said, it is really satisfying to hold an actual photo in your hands right after taking it. The color is cute too. It feels a little on the cheap side but I got it for $50 so can't complain! The exposure button is a little close to the aperture to be careful or your fingertip will appear in the corner of every photo.
Enjoyable for that teen!
Awesome and fun!
my little sister loved it and ran around taking pictures all night
Our granddaughter is enjoying her new camera.
I love my camera great for capturing moments recommend you buy
my daughter has really loved this little camera its perfect for her. but the film seems kinda high.
Great product, good picture quality
Works great, definetly worth the money.
instant film camera was a good deal for the money.  also like the color.  kind of difficult to find the film in stores but that's not really an issue.
so far so good bought about a month or two ago and its been great so happy i made the purchase , still getting the settings figured out for when your outside, I've found if i put the picture setting on the one it tells me , it hasn't come out right,  so be careful with that maybe its just me lol !
My daughter loves the camera and loves the memories. She loves to make scrap books.
Cute. Have zoom in function
My 14 year old Grand Daughter LOVES this!!! She couldn't stop saying Thank you!!!
Nice artifact.
Worth the price, instant pictures at your finger tips! Con: A little pricey for the film.
Great, no problems
Amazing product! thank you!
Nice camera ..I loved the color.
Great camera! Very easy to use! Bought for my daughters 9 th birthday, she loves it!The pictures are credit card shaped and look vintage, very cool!
Got this pink Instax Mini 8 for a good deal and was everything that my girlfriend wanted! Takes great stills, but you have to practice focusing it and setting it on the right setting for light and such. Looked new in box, but tape sealing it was broken.
quality of pictures is not as good as expected, but besides that easy to handle
This is the mini instant film camera. It comes in black. Blue. Pink. White. Yellow. Grape. Raspberry.  Indigo. It is lightweight and very portable. So easy to use. Easy to refill. So fun to use.  So handy to have on hand for those photo moments when you want to take a picture. And you get to have the picture printed there and then. Perfect.  This would really made a nice gift. Very fast shipping
EXCELLENT
The camera color is awesome. This was a birthday gift & our daughter loves it!
Perfect for elementary school kids.
Love my camera! So cute and easy to use. Package came fast, on time, and in perfect condition
I love this camera! It is extremely easy to use. The photo paper is pretty pricey but it is definitely worth it!
Great camera! Takes great pictures and is really fun!  Would highly recommend!
Cool
Gave this camera as a gift for my best friend's birthday and she absolutely loved it! It is well built and easy to use. I like the matte black, it looks very sleek.
My flash stopped working and I wasted an entire roll of film. Very disappointed.
takes great pix, n my daughter has so much fun with it!
We bought this for my daughter's birthday and she loves it!
My daughter love it..
Bought this for my daughters 14th B-day and she absolutely went crazy with taking pictures all night long. They enjoyed it so much, only thing was they went through 4 rolls of film in just a few hours time.
Gave me grass seed
I love it! Works great, just as decribed. Sugh a quick, fun way to capture moments.
This is a requested birthday present for my 11 year old granddaughter.  Her birthday is next month.Gram
I love it
its nice to have a hard copy.
Awesome! Got this for my daughter for her birthday.  She loves it. It is super easy to use and the camera has settings that help it take the best pictures depending on the light.  Thank you!
Very easy to use camera but I wish they had made this with zoom possibilities. When I take pictures it is definitely like old school where you cannot focus and you are literally just looking through the viewfinder to take your picture.
This is the perfect camera! I absolutely adore it!! If you are iffy about buying, don't! It's completely worth it!!
Super fun for special events. The photos come out great.
I absolutely love this camera!!!!! My pictures come out great and it's easy to use. I highly recommend this camera :)
Such a fun camera!  Pictures come out very vintage feeling.  So much fun to have little shots of your kids, family and friends.  My little one really loves watching the pictures come and waiting for them to expose.  Blast from the past fun!
Vintage and nice. Good for party to give the photos to the people right away. Photo size is a little small but good enough.
I bought this for a gift so we will see how it works when I give it to my granddaughter.
Was everything i wanted.  My girlfriend doesn't stop using it.  These pictures are alot of fun.
Bought one of these for my friends birthday and she loves it. I also got one for my birthday in baby blue and the pictures come out great.
I was so excited to order this after My cousin told me that she recieved one for her birthday .. It was delivered fast and came with the film I ordered, great camera easy to use not too big no complaints besides the film and the size of the photos were too small for me , so I returned and ordered the wide camera will write a review there once i recieve it in the mail
I didn't realize how many Polaroids it eats up and I'm very unsure despise very vague directions on how to use the settings. I bought the little rabbit lens I have no idea What the thing does
The camera is cute but I feel like it gets dirty easily.
I bought these for an adult "halloween" party, people ranged from 21-65+.. we had a blast, great photos, a bit small, so if you're looking for that "old polaroid" kinda 4x6 this is not the camera for you.. the photos are like 2x3 and the border takes up a bit of the frame. the good news is that the film is relatively inexpensive, compared to the "real" polaroid film that is still available..nostalgic, hip and quit surprisingly, even NEW to some people!!How quick we are to forget...the film takes a few minutes to actually "expose", people of the iPhone age can't relate.. they had a blank stare and many asked what they did wrong..or they'd stare in amazement from the film rising from the camera..hilarious!! ANYHOWI'm passing off to my children for a bit, but I'm definitely borrowing them for the next party!
I purchased this gift for  my daughter's 15th birthday and she absolutely loved it...it had different pic modes and one of them makes the pic look like the old school Polaroid cameras. ..it was worth every penny
Love it
I really liked this product. When you pop out the lens, it has 5 different settings. It also takes pictures pretty good for a polariod. I am going to use it for a sign in table at my wedding. I will update to see how it held up to that.
I love it. I don't regret getting it, because when o go to the stores its way too expensive and here I was able to get it.
ok
Came in when promised. Works perfectly.
This camera was purchased as a gift and the recipient loved it! Works well and the pictures turn out perfectly. Very happy with this purchase.
This is the perfect gift for a teenager or college student.  My college student was thrilled to receive this, and she's filled her room with garlands of the wee photos.  Yes the film is expensive, but buying in bulk saves money.  There's a learning curve to how to take successful photos which wastes a fair amount of film, but once you figure out lighting, the pics are lovely in an instamatic-y way.  I can't think of a gift my daughter has enjoyed or used more.
amazing product!
Love it!!!
My daughter keep taking pictures..
It takes amazing pictures with that vintage feel to it. Super adorable, easy to use. Arrived on time. If your looking for a way to keep those moments that you treasure then this is the camera for you!!
Very good buy !!!!
I love this camera so much
I like it
Worked perfectly 🎀
Purchased as gift for my sister. She loves it! It works well.
DON'T EVEN THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT IT. GET IT!!! all the colors are darling and they work amazing it's hard to stop taking pictures.The size is perfect, the color is too.Remember first put the batteries in AND THEN (don't turn it on) put the film in, line the yellow stripes. Close it turn it on. The first picture won't be a picture but the cover of the film, it'll be black . Don't panic! The next pic should be the actual Polaroid.The hi-key settings is for pictures that you want to turn out washed out, like white so don't use this outside in a sunny day! Use it in a dark environment.For cheapness, buy film in large quantities! Not a single 10 film packet 🙅 Also you should buy sticker frames instead of cute films! Its way way cheaper but that's up to you!Enjoy it and have fun!
This is even prettier in person. It is a great gift and way better price than in stores.
What is this yellow spot on my pictures ? It went from having a yellow discolouration to now just coming out plain white
thx
My favorite purchase on Amazon so far! It takes a little bit of playing with the settings and how far away you can be to get a good shot, but once you know what lighting works, you're good to go. The different colored frames on other film packs are super adorable too.
Love this, I take pictures of mostly my boyfriend and I. I really like have instant photos instead of phone pics, besides the waiting is fun
I love it!! I just wish film was cheaper and came with more
Thanks it is fantastic
IN LOVE WITH IT
So glad I bought this camera. I take it with me everywhere and always get compliments on it.
Love love love!!!
I gave this as a gift to my younger sister and she absolutely loves this camera. She takes it every where! It is totally worth the money, and the pictures come out amazing!
Fun!
Had to return it cause I wanted the white one instead but the camera is so much fun! Loved the way the photos turn out once they print out!
Amazing Camera and so fun to use!  However the first time it was dropped it broke.  I did buy the warranty plan, so just waiting now to see how that plays out...
Super easy to use, cool looking photos and the purple is nice and vibrant. Great product for teens and adults alike. Took it out of the box and was snapping photos in the matter of minutes. I was deciding between this and the more expensive version, so happy with my choice!
My daughter is very pleased with this camera.  Just wish that the picture films were less expensive!!!
Perfect Thank you
I love my camera! Learn how to use the settings though, otherwise your photos could be completely blown out or way too dark.
Bought this for my girlfriend before we went on a road trip. She absolutely loved it and her folks did too. They were surprised to see a film camera, let alone something like this. Takes amazing photos that you can keep just about anywhere.
Love my New camera and it takes wonder pictures
camera came in and we are enjoy that also
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH! My boyfriend got this as an early birthday present for me and I luuuurrrrve it so much. I haven't had any problems with film or anything. I've only taken three pictures because the film is pricey but otherwise it's great!
My favorite purchase this year... Great for scrapbooking
Easy to use and take clear photos
Amazing deal. Amazing product. I have two
Fun camera and love having instant pictures when I want them
An amazing device! Super cute, got as gift for my sister and she loves it! Easy to use and makes beautiful photos!
We bought this for our daughter for her birthday!  She absolutely loves it!
Overall a cute little camera, great for using to take candid photos for collages or scrapbooking.
This is a fun throwback to bring to parties and take drunk pics and put them on the persons refrigerator then take pictures of the pictures the next morning so they can be properly uploaded to Facebook.
Great gifts at affordable prices.
Good
Was disappointed to find that the entire packaging, instructions, etc were in Chinese/Japanese. This product was intended for purchase in Asia, not the US. The product works great but the batteries did not. They didn't work at all.
A++++++++
Hands down, the best gift for teen you know, be it a niece, cousin, friend, babysitter, neighbor, scrapbooker, etc. For me, kids between the ages of 10 and 20 can be so difficult to shop for. But even with Facebook and Instagram, kids love actual photographs of themselves and friends. Without fail, a Fujifilm Instax Mini Instant Film Camera in their favorite color is always an instant hit.
my new favorite thing! I feel I will be so creative with this camera!
Perfect everything!!
Love the camera and use it all the time.
I LOVE THIS!!!
SO. MUCH. 80's FUN!!! This is a blast, and the pictures are really unique & remind me of when I was a kid! My girls love taking pictures, and, while the pictures themselves are a little spendy, I think it is totally worth it, and have framed quite a few....it makes me smile every time I walk by the tiny pics hung up in the hallway!
Great stuff!
shutter sticks and we have wasted tons of expensive film, thinking it was user error...Too late to return very dissappointed 13 year old.  Every other picture is blank...
Love this!!! Super easy and fun for INSTANT gratification. Plus so cute to decorate your room or car with the pictures.
works well.  film can be kind of expensive but fun product nonetheless.  my girlfriend loves it
Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.
My granddaughter loved her little camera, though I was disappointed that it did not come with one packet of film, just the camera itself.  Fortunately, I had also purchased extra film, so she was not disappointed with her gift.I'd think a product obviously aimed at children would include at least a little film so they could use the camera immediately.
Attended expectations Good price.
Great camera and I love the color. It's cute and compact and such a portable size. Great for bringing around and taking pictures that are wallet sized and compact.
LOVE THIS CAMERA!
Very nice and cute :) I would recommend
I love this camera! It takes cute little instant pictures, and I'm glad that I can get film for it right at Walmart. This is inexpensive and awesome.
Love it!
excellent
I purchased the yellow Instax Mini 8, along with a accessorie package. The camera itself is absolutely WONDERFUL. I've taken several photos, and all of them have came out amazing. For a older style camera, the quality of the photos are excellent. After reading many, many reviews on this product I decided to buy it, and this is probably one of my greatest buys! I definitely recommend it. Soon I'll be purchasing this camera in different colors. 10/10
fun to use
I love this camera, it works well inside the house. I've tried many times to take pictures outside and if it is a cloudy day the pictures look washed out. I couldn't fully see myself it was almost blurry. I'm still testing it out, but inside the house works best.
Cool!!
It was blood gold! Takes damn good photos.
it was for my daughter ...its ok for a while ..she got bored
It was amazing. Came right on time for my birthday.
My daughter just loves it!!!!
My 10year old daughter loved this birthday gift.  We first saw it at a wedding set up for a photo booth.  It looks elegant, is incredible easy to use and is super cute. Instant gratification and the photos are pretty good quality...
A+
Awesome little camera with super cute instant photos. Amazon's delivery with this item was flawless and I could not be more happy to have been able to take pictures at my cousin's wedding since the camera came right on time!
Absolutely love this camera, takes great pictures. Didn't realize how much I missed point, shoot, and print cameras! So far this product is exactly what we are looking for! Going to use it for our wedding instead of hiring someone to do a photo booth for a ton of $$$
Very nice camera. Great quality!!!
This little camra is so fun and amazing!  We bought it for our 14 year old daughter so she could capture some memories at Disneyland. She had so much fun with it. Took really great pictures and just fun to have!
Love how I can take a picture and print it instantly
I had wanted a Polaroid since I was 6 yrs old and I'm SO happy to finally have one. I love the picture quality, you don't even need instructions it's so simple to you. I'm absolutely obsessed with it. Couldn't possibly be happier💛
They are soooo cute!
This was a hit. My daughter had a blast playing with this camera. Some of the pictures came out blurry but once we had the settings right they came out very clear. Really happy i chose this over the polariod, its a great camera and she loves it!
bought this for my 11 year old granddaughter for her birthday and she loved it.
It's a gift for my niece! She loves it!
Birthday gift for my daughter...she LOVES this camera!!
great!
I love this camera! It's so cute and perfect. I bring it around whenever I go on adventures and every picture makes me so happy!
EKKKKS!! It's so cute and I waited really long and thought hard about buying one of these. I went on a "hipster" vacation with a friend and this was the perfect addition to our trip. The white gets dirty really easily dirty, but it's nothing that a baby wipe can't clean up. This one has the pop out lens to turn on, and the flash. It tells you the "ideal" setting since there's a light sensor next to the flash where it detects the lighting in the area. Some pictures come washed out depending on the lighting and the flash together, but it gives it this great vibe!No complaints about the camera and I think it's a better investment from Amazon than Best Buy or another stores. Make sure you use the fujifilm instax COLOR film or else your camera won't work. The polaroid like picture comes out instantly (make sure not to shake it) and instant picture in your hand. It's pretty sturdy, comes with a strap for your wrist. I don't trust myself to just hold it by the straps, but it does look cute in your hand. Super reliable and captures the moment perfectly. Also, on the back of the camera, it tells you how many photos you have left. Once you pop in a new film set, it'll be at S (which is the plastic film). Once that first one is taken out, then it'll start the countdown which is really helpful. 10 seems really little, but it sometimes feels like a lot. The lens is wide enough to get two people for a selfie, but it naturally points lower, so hold your camera up a little higher!
The flash is not so good, but everything else is pretty good.
So awesome. Taking me back to the 90s when I always had my polaroid on me.
Got in on time, love it!!
Came fast also easy directions and the pictures always come out great.
I love it.
Such a fun camera to use! It is simple and easy to use, too! The film is reasonable. It serves it's purpose well. If you want an inexpensive, instant camera . . . this is the one to buy!! I used it for a wedding reception for guests to leave a photo and message for the bride & groom.
Great camera.  works great and takes fun pictures
Awesome camera GF loved it!
Awesome
Fun!
Like a lot
really good! Fun to use. I would suggest buying some white electrical tape and placing it over the flash, this will prevent your pictures from being flushed out, because the flash is really strong on this camera.
Takes good pics, but sometimes depending on the lighting, even when you specifically set it automatically goes back to what it senses??? Wouldn't be a big deal except the film gets expensive and since there's only 10pics per roll, it's a bummer when you specifically set it and it switches to auto mode and faces turn out way "whiter"...
My granddaughter loved it.
I love the Fujifilm Instax Mini so far. Really easy to use and awesome picture quality.
It's just the right size, cute, color as shown in the picture and my friend absolutely loved it! It's adorable and a great gift for anyone who wanted a Polaroid. The delivery also came on time and in perfect condition.
Super fun to have.  Cheaper online than michaels.
I love my fujifilm instax excellent camera for quick and cute pictures!
I love it!
A favorite gift of my granddaughter on Her eighth Bday.🎂
Bought this to use as a "guestbook" at our wedding. Our guests took photos of each other and all the photos are a great memento from our day! Our guests did have some issues with exposure (overexposed) but I think that was because some guests didn't know to change the settings. Most photos turned out great though!
Pictures are to small and its not a great picture either.
My only concern is that it takes dark pictures sometimes but my 17 year old daughter thinks it's perfect.
Got this for my 14 year for her birthday and she loves it.
Works perfectly. Only used a couple times so far, but my girlfriend loves it. Good picture quality compared to what I was expecting. Picture turned out darker but you can adjust it.
These products were great and so much fun. Pictures turned out clear. and great.  Would buy them again
I bought this item for my sister for the holidays. She was excited at the prospect of having an instant film camera. However, after only a few uses, she decided the pictures were not the quality she desired.
Was quick ..I am a happy costumer. .
Camera did not work, would not turn on at all. RETURNED
The battery cover is loose and always falls off.
Super fun camera!  Really love it!  Have taken loads of great photos with a "vintage feel" indoors, but still haven't figured out the settings for outdoors.  Adjusted the exposure several times, but so far photos have come out overexposed.  Will keep trying!
Takes great photos vintage style
I puchased it for a nine-year old girl and she loved it!  It is easy to use and the raspberry color made a big hit, too!
My daughter loves it
Amazing
Bought this for my husband's niece as a high school graduation gift, along with a few packs of film. She was thrilled to get it.
Bought this for a roadtrip.  Easy to use.  Really enjoyed having instant photos to put into my travel journal each day.  We were traveling in the desert so some photos were a bit over-exposed even when the light meter was set on the highest level, but I kinda like the blown out look.  I did forget to check the meter on several occasions and totally ruined those pictures.  You definitely have to train yourself to adjust the settings first!
I was in LOVE with this.But after 3 weeks it stopped changing settings. I would turn it but the light would just stay on the home picture. But it really is amazing as long as it works.
The directions are absolutely inscrutable.
Great instax camera. Great when you need a picture now!
I love this camera. It's quick and easy to use. The only down side is if you take pictures outside and it is already dark, you have to be pretty close to the camera for the flash to work-- otherwise you're left out of the picture. I got this camera for an anniversary present from my fiancé. He did all of the research and picked it out. I can honestly say that if I would've had to choose my own camera (instead of receiving this as a surprise), I would've picked this same one. The pictures are great quality and the camera is sturdy. I couldn't be more excited and happy with this.
Great quality
Well-built. Lovely color. I've tested it and it works... Except for the lights on the high-key dial: I would change the setting, but the option I select would not light up.
my favorite color and favorite instant camera!
Love this camera I can't wait to buy more.
best camera ever!
I'm having a terrible time with my camera! none of the pictures are coming out on any setting in any different lighting! I'm frustrated! I'm pretty sure i wasted my money!
Purchased this for my child as a birthday present. She loves this camera. The pictures are the size of a credit card and has pretty good quality. We love the instant gratification you get.  I would recommend this product for adults and children, very easy to use.
My daughter loves it.
It's perfect for my wedding!
A fun version of the classic polaroid, great colors. Easy to use.No zoom, very simple
I love it 
I love my camera, it came on time and nothing was broken or damaged. the box didn't have any dents when I got it. It shipped on time and I'm really happy with the product.
Great price! My teens love this camera
It's aiight. Fun, but don't expect a digital shot, ya'll.
Perfect
I am so glad I purchased this camera. I debated it for months and finally gave in. It was worth the cost in my opinion. I wish the film was cheaper. It is a little bulkier than I had expected. I enjoy it.
Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera (Pink)I'm not into stuff like this. But my girlfriend is super trendy and hipster and she loves it!
She loves it.
I LOVE THIS CAMERA! IT'S VERY CUTE AND STYLISH AND DOES THE JOB.
cool stuff
Nice  product and  the  quality is  excellent , recommended
I adore this camera, the only mild drawback is that the film can get pretty expensive but that is alright because it is an awesome way to take pictures. No editing, just pure picture taking. I adore the color as well.
fast shipping, great price
At time! Good!
love it
love it awesome
The film isn't cheap, but the novelty is worth it. A lot of fun for any age. I wish it used Instax Wide film instead of Mini for bigger prints.This camera has zero low-light functionality unless your subject is less than a few meters away. Tried to capture a picture at twilight, but it came out completely black lol.
I purchased this one because it came with a pack of film. The photos so far have come out really washed out. I hope it's an issue with the film and not the camera. The camera has fun accessories (purchased seperate) and is really easy to use.
Bought two of these. Returned both because their electronics are lacking.  Put in film (film is expensive) and a battery.  Camera takes 10 pictures by itself.  You don;'t even have to press any buttons-it continues shooting - it's self focusing and self shooting even though you can't use any of the "pictures."Then when you return it, Amazon charges a restocking fee to restock a worthless item.Don't think so.  Cute when it works but you might not need the hassle.
Ordered this for my daughters 13th birthday. She loves the camera and has found it very easy to use. The film is fairly affordable, but not so much when a 13 year old girl takes pics of everything in sight the first couple days. I would highly recommend this product.
LOVEEEEEEE IT! IT'S AMAZING IN EVERY WAY!  BUY IT! !! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!
Great camera that takes great instant photos!
great
This is such a GREAT camera!!! A great camera for a great price. I've only taken one picture, and I am SO IMPRESSED! Before buying this camera however, consider the cost of film. Film is expensive! For 50 pictures it cost about $47 dollars. >_<
Amazing!!
I absolutely loved it! I wasn't able to be at my place when it got delivered and they came the next day which I think is the best! Oh and camera is very cute(:
Love this camera but color is more A tangerine then raspberry. Sent back and got the grape it's perfect!
It said it came wit films but it doesn't🖕🏼👎🏽
Lovely little camera. Just like the classic Polaroids of the 90s. Highly recommend.
Bought this as a gift for my step-daughter.  She was very happy about it.  She doesn't use it as much as anticipated though because of having to purchase film.  From what I saw, the quality of the pictures was really good.
haven't used this yet. It will be a Christmas gift for my daughter.  It's very pretty, so I hope it works well.
Fabulous camera for making personalized cards.
film is expensive to buy
Excelent Product
Works great, just like description! Fun and easy to use! Love my new pictures!
I got this new but when I tried to change the light exposure setting, it didn't work. It was kind of lame
Takes excellent pictures!!!  love it!!!
This was a fun item at a big party.  I used this along with some photo booth props also purchase on Amazon.  Fun, memorable photos created at an instant at the party. You can take 2 shots:  keep one and the other give to your friends.
I really love it!! It works great, came fast, and takes great pictures :) BTW just in case some are wondering if it comes with the film included IT DOESN'T, but you can always order some! :)
I bought this camera for my little sister to give to her on her 13th birthday. She is just starting to get into photography and this is a nice and fun compliment to the rest of her photography arsenal. Not having to wait to upload the pictures onto a computer or have the film developed at the store results in some instant gratification and reminds me of the good ole days when I was younger than she is now. It is a bummer that you have to routinely spend more money in order to buy more film but my little sister loves it and that is good enough for me! Her bulletin board is full of pictures she has taken in the few weeks of owning it.
My 9 year old loves her new camera...she takes it everywhere she thinks she'll have some good photo ops!  Photos are cute size...small..but perfect for her at this age! Surprisingly good quality photos too if you make sure to change the lighting indicator as instructed.  Love it!
We loved this camera, it was the hit of the party! Ordered another for a Christmas present for someone on my list!
CuteCamera great for making memories and displaying it In my room!
It's cute, we get compliments on it all the time. Most people don't know something like this still exists and most call it a Polaroid.The pics are smaller than old Polaroid but the camera is also smaller and easier to take around with you. It's fun to give friends a souvenir to take home.Only complaint is its hard to get the exposure right. It gives you suggested exposure but getting things wrong at $0.80 a pop kind of sucks. Oh wells, it's part of the process I suppose.
This product is good but I have couple concerns about this camera (I don't know if it is due to my poor photographing skills or the product itself.)1) the film always come out empty, or white?2)it's somehow out of focus, even when I'm aiming right in the circle and it's super blurry when the film comes out even when I adjusted to the right mode3) I have to press the button really hard to get a film ( don't know why)I have attached some pictures as a proof.Don't know if  I should return this product and purchase a new one? This is a great product, I love it but I'd also like to get it fixed before it gets worse.
purchase it for my 15 year old and it takes good pictures she loves it
It works just as expected. It's so cute and it's a great size for carrying around with me throughout the day.
super fun to use.  pictures are great compared with other instant cameras!
In love with my camara
I love it! it's so cute and I love the color.
I love it
My daughter was super happy to receive this for her birthday.  It works very well.
Great Product!
Daughter loves it.
great for a gift! and inexpensive for what it can do!! Love it!
we used it as a fun activity during my wedding, everybody loves it! the vintage feel and the instant picture made guests excited! and like most of my friends who saw it wanted one! :D very good purchase!
Love this camera. It's so much fun. Thank you for fast shipping and a great product
Love it
I couldn't be more happy with the Instax camera, it's my new, favorite obsession. It's extremely easy and fun to use. It's well worth the money!
It was a gift and she loves it
I am so happy I purchased this camera, the item arrived quickly & promptly. It is definitely worth it! I am so happy to capture memories in this form. I plan to make a scrap book soon! The camera is light weight and certainly met up to my expectations.
Bought for my teenager. She's very happy with it.
I've wanted this camera for so long until I finally just ordered it on a wimb and I can't be happier! Film for it can get pretty expensive but it's totally worth it and I love how the pictures turn out.
Cute as can be to be the first camera for my 9 year old granddaughter.Easy to use and can see the picture right away.
Just how I wanted it! Thanks so much!
I love it!!!!!! It's very cute and the pictures are very very very clear!!!!
my daughter is addicted.thanks!
I love this camera. It's really fun and exactly what I expected. I gave it 4 stars because I realized I will not be able to use this camera as much as I would probably like to because the film (to me) is a little on the pricey side. When I do buy it I will definitely buy from Amazon though because you get a better deal over anywhere else I've seen; however, figure about a dollar a picture. It's still definitely worth to buy.
i thought the camera itself would be heavy! its really lightweight and the wrist strap holds really well. im super happy with it! i think its worth the price! photo quality is great too!
My daughter loves the camera.  The initial camera we purchased stopped working without cause.  We were sent a new one expediently.  I highly recommend the square trade warranty.  They were easy to work with and there was no hassle.
Awesome camera! Great quality!
smaller in your hand than i thought, which is great! can't wait to really use it. its adorable!
Delighted with camera, birthday present for my Grandaughter.
My daughter LOVES this camera but is unhappy with the color choice she selected (white).  She would recommend a darker color that would hide scuffs and dirt better!!
Amazing camera, would recommend
I received mine today, and it's so cute! it comes with the little strap and batteries as well, it works perfect fine, I'm in love!!!
I love my instax mini!! this type of film is the best!!! the color is more pink than vintage pink but i still love it!! great product just wish the film wasn't so expensive but would definitely buy this again.
Haven't tried it out as of yet but it sure is cute ! Can't wait ! Comes with batteries as well
produces surprisingly good quality photos. pics are small...very small.
Received it sooner than expected! Super excited to start using it. I'm satisfied with my transaction. Thank you so much! :)
I totally love my fujifilm camera <3
film runs quick and is pricey.. love the camera but film runs too quickly..
loved it!
So cool! Very easy to use. I can't wait to use this for guests at my sisters birthday.
great camera, works perfectly. going to use for my wedding guest book! easy to use.
Love it!
Great products
We purchased this camera for our baby shower to have guests take pictures, paste them into a memory book, and write a message.  For our wedding, we used an instant printer and the quality was just not great so we were diappointed.  With the Instax camera, the quality is excellent and the film is reasonable if purchased in 50 packs.  The time between shots is less than 15 seconds, so our event planners were able to go around and take pictures of all our guests at the party.The only downside was that when pictures were taken in extreme sunlight, the quality looked somewhat washed out.  The built-in flash did better than expected and indoor photos looked perfect.
The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant camera is an awesome way to have some vintage photography fun in a world that seems to have gone completely digital! This camera instantly prints out pictures (about the size of a credit card) using film and runs on two AA batteries as its power source. There is also a built in flash and multiple settings to ensure you get the perfect shot each time. You will not find a more reasonably priced "polaroid"camera today!The Good: Excellent price, Easy setup, LOTS of vintage fun!The Bad: The suggested light setting indicator can sometimes be inaccurate, leading to washed out pictures (you'll figure out which setting works best with practice, so don't rely too much on the suggestions). Also, although the film is relatively cheap, it is still expensive at almost 50 cents a picture.
Just received this for my 8 year old and she loves it! Although, the front plastic lense cover fell off. Now pics have a purple spot on them d/t flash. I'm wondering if I can order this pieces or if I need to return it?
fun polaroid camera. outdoor pictures not as colorful and cute as indoor, but perfect for taking indoor pictures of people!
Love this camera. The downside about this camera is that you can't take it in very bright light. For example, at the beach with the sun shining on top of you. You will get a white image cause its so bright outside. Overall, its a must camera.
My granddaughter's Christmas gift, so can't tell how it works, if it works, etc.  It is just what she asked for and I am hoping she will love it.
A good, fast camera.  Wish that the pictures were a little larger like the old Poleroids but can put them through a machine probably and enlarge them.  Good when you  need an instant moment in time.
the camera was perfect and the delivery was right on time. AMAZING!
LOVE! Easy to work, easy to figure out. Prints the cutest pictures. Bought it for my 9 year old and she is a pro already.
Awesome Gift for my fiance pictures come out amazing, great buy.
I got the yellow one, and i love it. Use it a lot!
It was purchased for a 12 year old granddaughter. She loves it. Finds it easy to use. Loves the color. Really nice photos too.
The camera is easy to use with different themes to pick from.
I bought this as a gift for my husband's teenage cousin. She's in love with it.
it was for my Granddaughter. She loved her camera and it arrived  within a day. It was great as she needed it for an event and it came in time.
I love this camera! it takes great pictures and comes in the original box with instructions and everything! I got expedited shipping, and it came amazingly fast! I assure you, getting better shipping is worth it all! completely recomend to anyone looking for a great product!
A+
I LOVE this camera. It's cute and I love the instant pictures! Works and looks great.
excellent camera. Takes great photos. My daughter loves it. The pictures are a great size for collages or just carrying in your wallet
love love love love!!!! so cute and great, thanks!
I like it, it's fun!
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Its more red when it comes tho
Camera was exactly as described.  Purchased as a gift for my granddaughter and she absolutely loves it.
Too pricey and pictures too small  :(
This little camera is so much fun. I used it to take pictures of my grandkids when I went on vacation to see them and then created memory books for all five of them that they could keep after we left. They love their memory books so much and look at them every day. The only problem I had was the pictures taken outside and bright light didn't turn out but the pictures taken inside were fabulous. It's a little pricey picture cost about a buck apiece but it was worth it in the end and I'm glad I bought it.
Birthday gift for a 12 year old girl and she was so happy. Suggest buying more than a 5 pack of instant film....you will need it if you're 12.
Prints high-quality, vintage-style pictures in a flash! Way better than the original. I could not be more pleased​ with my Instax Mini 8!
Amazing little camare i love it for the first  time :)
Bought this for my son's 3rd birthday party, as part of a photo booth - the kids and adults loved it! Took a bit to get used to how it worked but was fairly easy to figure out. Kids were even using it, and loved that the pictures came out "right away".The white is very modern looking, and the film was easy to figure out and load - overall this was a good purchase, and a fun one too!
Normally when one makes a purchase like mine, buying a camera, you would also get at least one film cartridge, right? Well I didn't. There was no mention of not having one sent with the camera. I looked hard and re read the discrimination. So I assumed it came with one. Well it didn't. The camera is a bit pricey. I had to go to the other side of town to find the film. I like the camera, but not what I had to go through to complete it.
This is a very cool color. I love it and it is compact and takes great pictures.
Within 2 months it broke, I dont know what happened but the camera stopped producing the pictures.  The film is stuck. Such a bummer.
We love this camara. We use it for parties to give photos to friends as they leave. The film is expensive and or hard to find if you forgot to order online. Only one little specialty shop carries the film. So we just stock up.... ;)
The product is so cute and everything is perfect as it described. Thank you so much
Purchased for our wedding and it was great.
I love this camera quite low price. Tip. I need to put the setting for the light one setting higher than the real light other wise my pics are over exposed. (example I put on full sun when have slightly overcast)
I love it❤️
so fun!
Worked great for a wedding. When signed the guest book we took a picture to go with it.
The photos don't come out as clear as you would expect.  Older poloroids had better quality.  I expected better for the price!
As soon as I received the camera I opened it right away and noticed a scratch on the inside of the lens. The pictures still come out good but it bugs me knowing it's there.
Good
Everything was perfect!
Super neat!
My new husband was very impressed with this camera. We purchased it for out guest to take pictures. It was a big success.
The flash did not work. We ruined part of a package of pricy film trying.
It looks great! Brand new, photos look amazing, they develop within seconds of taking the picture! I can't wait to use it more :)
It's so cute, and I love that it doesn't have to be charged or anything like that... all it needs is film. I got this adorable camera and decorative camera sticker to go on it, and I'm always taking pictures with it. I'm super happy with this purchase.
Awesome little camera! Love it.
It takes very nice and good quality pictures, but it sometimes breaks down on me and I end up wasting about 4 films.
No it does not come with a selfie mirror but its still a really cute unique color!! I haven't seen anyone with the same color and i love it!
I am very happy with this camera! The product arrived quickly, in complete packaging including directions in many languages. The included strap is woven yellow fabric. The camera works perfectly, taking small photos with a limited range flash. It is ideal for candid shots of friends at a party, or still life photos. It takes practice to use the flash well, but every photo has charm.
i like i
AWESOME
I looove it 
My family's over the moon when I purchase this camera ON MY OWN. They didn't know that I have enough gift card to buy it. My family love polaroid, but in Indonesia, this camera cost us arms and legs. We basically couldn't afford it. So yeah, I love it. The camera came out new, no problem at all, as I expected. Work perfectly well and trust me, I will not lie. So yeah, if you're planning to buy this camera, just buy it already. It's worth it.
good item
Good!
My daughter was so excited to receive this and after a few months it no longer works! The settings don't work nor does the flash which makes it completely useless. Should have bought the Polaroid and not this version
Love it. I bought this to document the planning of my vintage wedding. I can't wait to use with my bridesmaids. Works great so far!
Great!  A fun camera with quirky retro pictures.  :-)
Thank you
It's great!!
Waste of money...fuuu
I really do love this camera. We used it for our wedding as our guestbook. Worked perfectly! The downside is that if you try to use it in the sun (or on a super sunny day) the pics come out totally white. At least for me they did, even when you cover the flash or adjust the lighting setting. Still a great camera and love using it even now!
I can not say enough how much I love this camera! Obviously be careful with it and it will last. Takes wonderful photos, great for every occasion. My younger sister was so fascinated by the concept she now wants her own.
Absolutely perfect!
Just received this product today and I have to say I am so satisfied with this product. It is so simple to use, just pop in the film (film is not included but batteries are) turn it on, set dial to the lighted setting and snap a photo (flash is always on).  The pictures come out very nice and take about 10 minutes to fully develop. The camera came with a strap (polka dot one which I am not fond of) and directions with pictures only which was a little confusing. Overall it's great and so fun.
THANK YOU
Really like the camera and how easy it is to use
Nice mini pictures.
This is the single best investment I've ever made in my life. The camera and film are well worth the money!! I have a cousin who is a professional AP photographer, and he's obsessed with his Fujifilm Instax too.I never leave home without it. I take it to bars, baseball games, vacation. Everyone laughs when they first see it, and then will not stop using it; I have to pry it away from people. It's a great conversation piece, and a great way to make friends and meet people, especially if you're an introvert like me. Heads up: Polaroids are also a great way to get free drinks from bartenders!Amazon is the cheapest place I've found for anything from Fujifilm. I know this is a bad comparison, but Urban Outfitters is selling this same camera for $100 minus tax and shipping. I didn't even check to see how much they're charging for film.
Was very disappointed. The button you use to take a picture broke and for some reason every time you would take a picture, it would come out completely black. I ended up just throwing it away and buying one at Walmart very disappointed waist of money.
There's a bit of cognitive adjustment for someone used to using a digital camera, but once you get over that, this camera is very easy to use and very fun. Be sure to pay attention to the light dial suggesting which exposure to use-- with the ten sheets film pack, a few mistakes will burn through your whole roll pretty quick, so it's important to use the right exposure.
color is adorbs! works well even after dropping in a low surf at beach!
Love! Film is expensive though.
My kids absolutely adore these cameras!! The are so easy to use and they take super cute photos. This yellow one has amazing color that does not fade. Love this!
My daughter loved it!
My bestfriend got one and I wanted one so bad I love it thanks!!!
White gets a little grimy at time but I've had it for about 10 months and it works wonderfully. Easy to use and carry around!
This little camera is so much fun and my daughter has absolutely loved using it. It takes decent pictures, is quick, and easy to operate. Lots of fun to have with this!
My mom bought this for me for my birthday and I love it! It takes great pictures and it is basically the talk of a party. Film is kind of expensive but it is reasonable. Love it!
I love this camera! For the price, its great! However, if you are looking for a camera with more features, you should probably research the more expensive ones. I like the size and weight of this camera, its substantial while still easy to carry around in your bag without being too heavy or take up too much space. So far Ive only taken two photos with it, and I am still playing around with the different light settings, but I already know i'll be taking this everywhere with me!
The lighting might be tough to dial in. I've had a few that were too dark and one that was too light, but it's a super fun little camera.
Super fun! Take it every where!
Cute....no selfie mirror though
Excelente!
such a great, fun camera.  I love the the pics it produces.  Such a great camera to bring to a party and hand out the pics
The color of the camera was a bit darker then the picture but I love it! Still trying to figure out which settings work best in the lighting. Love having pictures instantly!
As advertised.  Great camera, arrived on time.
It's awesome
Really cute camera.
This is the best camera I have ever had. So easy to use, I love the instant pictures. Fun to share with friends. Love it.
Nice!!!
Love the little pics my daughter takes with this camera.  Great buy!
Novelty camera, photos are small and washed out. Don,t waste your money
Love the camera! Looks and works great!
This camera right out of the box was amazing! Ease of use gets an A++ and quality as well. The photos come out looking great.As for light control, there's a dial on the lens that allows you to adjust the shutter speed to current light, "Indoors, Cloudy, Partly Cloudy, Sunny, Hi Key".Although not your larger, "classic", size photo,  this is quite the camera for capturing memories in a way that doesn't just pass you by like our thousands of photos on our phones.. I highly recommend this product to people looking to capture special events. Used it for our first child's Baby Shower and everyone was able to take a photo home for the memory. Very nice experience for all!
My daughter loved it!! So happy with it
I bought this camera as a birthday gift for my sister. She absolutely loved it! In the digital age where everything is online she was so excited to have instant "old school" pictures.
Absolutely LOVE this thing. It's so cute and compact and easy to use. I've already gone through most of the film I've bought. I'm going to use this for a guest book at my wedding, so people can include a picture in there "words of advice".
Takes a bit of trial and error adjusting the setting, and maybe a few film sacrifices. Other than that great camera.
Wow! I bought this camera for my daughter's 11th birthday.  She already has a digital camera, and a phone.  But this "new" technology of instant camera prints blew her mind.  She declared it the most awesome gift she's ever received.  I never had a polaroid growing up, and I was thrilled with how easy it is to use, how lightweight and intuitive the camera is, and how cool the photos turn out.  My daughter likes the "retro" look of the prints.  I am very happy with this purchase.
Gave 4 stars because I think the camera is awesome, but the color is not Raspberry it's more like a dull coral.  My daughter wanted a bright pink color and saw this and was like no I don't want that color.  So just know that the color is not a bright pink before you buy it, the color on the box is Raspberry but the camera is not.  I returned and am going with a different color
Bought for 17 year old daughter birthday. She loves it. Picture quality is great.
Had the camera for exactly 6 months and 5 days. Just went to turn it on and take some pictures and it wont turn on. Replaced batteries and still nothing. I've tried everything and it appears its just defective. Pretty expensive camera for it to completely stop working after 6 months.
I absolutely love this camera! The reason why I gave it four stars is because it broke a month after I purchased it. I would have to take a picture several times for the camera to actually push the film out. Amazon sent me a new camera, but I wasted so much film due to this.
My daughter loves it!!!
Great camera!
Fun, small camera and takes good pictures.
Amazing camera! Super easy to use love it:) came in great condition
Super cute and fits in regular sized bags which is convienet. Buy extra film cause you're going to want to use this everywhere.
Love this lightweight instant camera. The photos of the camera make the prints seem a little small but they are really the perfect size and the camera is incredibly easy to use. It is turned on by pressing a button near the lens and turned off by pushing the lens itself inward. I will admit that this made me a little wary at first because it makes it seem cheap but I have had no problems with it and have gotten great photos with each shot!
tHE CAMERA LOOKS GREAT BUT MY GRANDAUGHTER HAS NOT USED IT YET.  I THOUGHT FILM FOR THE CAMERA WAS IN THE "BUNDLE" & SHE NEVER SAW IT.  AM I MISTAKEN/?BARBARA K MC CORMICK
Took a minute to get used to......love the old school!
AWESOME CAMERA!!!!!!!!!!!! GLAD I PURCHASED IT.  PICTURES ARE GREAT.
Awesome camera! Very fun and easy to use. Film is expensive, but what isn't these days?
My 15 year old loves this camera. The film is very expensive, but it is a very fun camera she uses with her friends.
I am very happy with the product. It serve its purpose quite well: I use it at home for guests, since it is not something very handy to carry around in trips. :-)
I'm in love I just got my Insta mini8 in today early then said to be . good thing just in time for camping I tested it out I have to say looks great  I'm amazed reading some reviews had me skeptic but I'm happy with my choice although the film a little pricey it's worth it !
Love this camera. The price is really good compared to the same exact model at Best Buy.
Works great. Have gone through 4 packs of film and it takes great pictures for the camera.  It's not an expensive high tech piece, so I wasn't expected masterful pics.  The prints come out looking a little "antiqued", but I like that for this type of film. The camera is plastic and feels fake, but again, it's not an expensive high tech piece.  My two year old even took a picture with it "accidentally" and no issues.
Great camera. My daughter loves it!
I really like this. It's very cute and super portable. The camera comes equipped with different shooting modes depending on what the lighting is, and the indicator light will tell you which mode it believes you should be in. This is just a plain point and shoot. There are no fancy settings to let you zoom or anything, you pretty much get what you get with this. It comes with an arm strap which is actually very handy and convenient. However, the film is super pricey. Additionally, I wouldn't change out of the original setting when shooting because everytime I put it on the setting it suggests the picture comes out awful. It's very tricky to figure out how to take a picture only because the circle of focus, isn't what the camera focuses on once you take the picture, so honestly it's a guessing game when taking a picture up close. Pictures taking at a distance are a lot easier to take. Also, if you get too close to a subject, and I mean within like 1.5 feet, the whole picture basically comes out white because the flash is so intense. Also, if you are outside and it is super sunny and you put the mode on the sun, the picture just comes out with a white glow on it, if it is cloudy and the camera suggests you use the cloudy setting, the picture comes out a black hazy blob.However, once you work out the kinks and get to know the camera I think it's very neat and I prefer to use it over my 6plus
Awesome!!!
I just love the camera the pictures that come are excellent
works great
Great camera just that occasionally my pictures do not fully or don't develop
its an awesome camera
Picture quality is not great but it keeps my daughter happy.
Product arrived a day earlier than expected, which was a nice surprise. It was poorly packaged, and I honestly would have expected there would be damage, but luckily there wasn't... The actual camera is pretty awesome and I started using it immediately to check how well it worked. Don't know why people were complaining about the quality of the photos it produces, because mine works great. Obviously it won't be super hi-def quality, but it gives you Polaroid quality that gives it that cool vintage look/feel. I love it! Will be buying lot of film in the near future. :)
the package was good it was all amazing
Love love love this!!! Nice price, great product, easy to use.
Excelent
I absolutely LOVE this camera and the company shipped extremely fast.
It works so well, I love this.
Love it so much!
Love the color, and this camera is a lot of fun for my friends and me.
This was given to my daughter as a Christmas gift and she likes it very much.
Gift, child is happy.
It did not come with a selfie camera, so while it still works as an Instax, I give it one star for lying on its description.
My granddaughter loves it.
Best thing I've bought in a while! I love thus camera!
going to use this for a guest book for my grandmothers 90th birthday. got it today and tried it out... took everything for me to not use all the film :)
Such an awesome camera love it
i love it! perfect size and everything! and the film doesnt cost too much either. i chose the free standard shipping and it took like a week and a few days to come but other than that it is great!
Great camera works well
So cute & fun! We're having a blast capturing memories with this awesome camera!
Camera came in excellent condition. I got a film bundle with the camera, and shot pictures fine. Great camera all around for any occasion. The one thing I wish though is there to have a flash button to turn the flash off, but other then that it is awesome!
Super cute and easy to carry around everywhere with me!
This was one of my best decisions i have ever made. its so cute and the cheepest price on the market. works great and super duper cute! i think everyone should get one. quality is great and a nice fit in the hand. High remarks about this.
Quite easy to use and was a present....
My daughter loves the product. Customer Service and product expectations where met. Love it.
Had some glitches with the ejector for the film but it is overall a really good camera for the price.
So great, purchased this for a 10th birthday. It was a huge hit !
great product
I really liked the camara
So happy with it. It's perfect
It works for what I ordered it for perfectly. I am a real estate investor and I need pictures that I can put on paper with tape and then fax and they are just the right material, not too thick for a fax machine. Not so big they take up too much room. Besides all that it is fun to take pictures and see them instantly. perfect for what I needed.
Picture shows includes film yet received product and no film. Please advise!
Awesome!
Great
4 stars only because i purchased mine through warehouse deals and did not come with batteries and the string was missing that's suppose to attach to cam. i guess thats expected when getting it cheaper. but other than that it works great and pictures come out vintage and credit card size which makes them adorable:) buy it you wont be dissapointed;)
Got this as a present for a friend! She said the pictures may come out dark in too much sunlight
I purchased this item for my 13 year old granddaughter.  She likes it, but has not used it enough to offer meaningful feedback.Delivery was prompt.  I was surprised it was delivered on Sunday.
Great fun for my wife
Love this camera, makes cute business card size pictures.
good
Perfect
BESTTTTTT Love it!!!
Adorable camera!  came with a cute yellow and white polka dot strap.
It came on time & my daughter loves it :)
dank
price is very competitive
Really like this camera. I'm not big into taking pictures (with a real camera or with a phone) but I like the novelty of the tiny pictures this prints out. I took it on a recent trip and loved the moments I was able to capture.  I'm giving it 4 stars because the film cartridges are pricey!
We setup a photo "booth" at the company picnic and took instant photos to give the guests. It was a huge success!  The light meter helped determine the best setting for a well-lit outdoor photo. Guests enjoyed watching their photo develop too!  We took over 60 photos in a matter of hours and everyone was delighted with the results. Using the Instax Mini 8 camera instead of a digital camera ended up being a fantastic idea.The flash is bright. Really bright!  To help diffuse the flash I covered it with a piece of clear contact paper.  It helps when taking close-up portraits. I also dialed down the aperture setting when the subjects wore white and light colors to keep them from being overexposed.  The photo booth portraits came out great!The camera works great.  Film packs are easy to load and the picture counter is large and easy to read.  The lens takes a wider angle picture than you see through the view finder, so take that into consideration when you're framing your subjects.  I wear eyeglasses and found the viewfinder to be a bit small.  A larger viewfinder would improve the photographer's experience.
my granddaughter (13) loves it
My daughter loves it. She can share her pictures instantly with her friends.
I was nervous to buy this for my friend for her birthday... but I made the right decision. She loves it. There is just something so rewarding about getting a picture instantly! It's easy to use, detects which setting you should be on automatically, is super light weight, and prints out the cutest business size pictures with great quality. Love it.
i love it
This camera is an absolute necessity for everyone. This is the third one I've bought! I gift them to people because they are simply a fun and easy way to make and share memories. Pro tip: buy the 6 pack of film because it ends up being the cheapest per box.
Wonderful camera!  Got it for my 10-year-old daughter for her birthday and it's her favorite gift!  Love it!
Awesome
First of all when I received it, in front of those light keep blinking and its wont let me take pictures.. I wait til tomorrow and try again it's work! Very excited and soon disappointed again! No matter where I adjusted the light level. It's not moving! All the I got either it's really dark or very bright! Waste my 10 mini film !
Used this for a wedding guest book alternative and the guests loved it!
Loved it!
The camera works wonderful and it was the best deal I found!
Love this camera. The instant gratification of your pictures being printed instantly is fantastic
Camera came/delivered two days after I ordered it (the day between ordering and delivery was a Sunday too!) in great condition. Instructions came in English and several other languages, along with helpful pictures to show how to operate the camera without much reading required.
I bought this for my 17 year old for her birthday. She loves it! It's retro, but easy to use. The Fugifilm Instax Accessory Bundle Set is a 'Must Have'! It's also easy to get film for.
Takes great pics
Easy to use, instant gratification and lots of fun for teens who want more than posting pics.
absolutely love my Polaroid! easy to use and small enough to carry around! although the Polaroid can easily get scuff marks on. the best way to use the Polaroid is by watching a video on how to use so every picture will come out great!
great camera
Love love love! Can't stop taking pictures!!
SOOOOO CUTE and so much fun.
This camera is so fun, cute and reliable. My daughter has made a scrapbook of all her moments in time since she got this camera. She is 13 and loves it.
Gave this a bday gift and daughter loves it. A bit pricey having to constantly purchase film but it's to be expected. Nice shade of blue and works exactly as it should.
My daughter love it,and I do also we took it to a trip and it's so cool to experience instant pic without been able to edit or repeat it 100 times.LOL
Was NOT the color I ordered. I wanted raspberry, received a very dull, red camera instead. Very disappointed
Granddaughter is thrilled, camera works great!
I like it ,but after the first pic it start to shot black (blank) pics.
Really Good Camera, Takes a few minutes to understand how to operate it (i didn't look in the manual) but overall its pretty easy and very light.Takes about 5-10 seconds to the image to Appear on film.
This was a gift, but my friend seems pretty happy with it.
Love everything about it except the sun light switch control  didn't last one use. It switches on its own and won't switch when you turn the lense. I wouldn't even care except it actually effects the picture. I'm not sure if this is a common problem or not. So overall I have to give it one star because it didn't last 2 hours. If it worked then it would be five stars.
cute!
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT... CAME SUPER QUICK.....GREAT QUALITY BEST PRICE
Perfect gift, daughter loved it
cool camera. only thing is doesn't come with film. you have to buy it separately
I love bringing this camera when I go to Disney! The pictures come out so good! I recommend taking outdoor shots when the sky is clear for a more "enhanced" shot.
This is absolutely the cutest little camera! It was exactly what I wanted: old school pictures in a modern little package! I absolutely love it! Everyone that has seen me with it wants one too!
Its been a week and i feel the camera is Awesome. We used it as novelty item for our party and all our guests loved it..Buy one for urself and I'm sure your guests will be impressed..
Cute and quaint. A role of film is about 20$.
I purchased this fujifilm camera for my wedding. I had a seating chart in which you wuold take your name and replace it with a picture of yourself. It was a huge success and a hit! I'm so happy to have the printed pictures of my guests and the memories we made taking them. It worked well:)
need to get more. lovely gift.
I love this, I basically wanna take it everywhere. READ HOW TO ADJUST YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING BEFORE TAKING YOUR PICTURES. If they come out horrible, it's cause you did it wrong.
My daughter enjoys taking pictures.
Replaced the originally item only to find out the replacement is just as bad. The adjustment dial doesn't not change.
I normally don't write reviews but I have to say that this camera is awesome!  I took it with me while taking my daughter to practice so I can test it. I had so many  complements about this camera and the image came out clean. One of the Best purchase I've made.
My daughter love her camera excellent product very nice pictures
Nice instax mini 8 instant film camera! It takes nice pictures instantly!
love the camera! comes with batteries!
I love this camera. It was exactly what I expected it to be but I gave it a 4 because while it was in my bag it must've gotten jostled around enough to mess with the way the lights work. The exposure is fine but the lights indicating what setting is being used doesn't always work. It not like I was being rough with it while it was in my bag either. I would like it to be more durable but I sill love it.
Have had for almost a year and still works like a charm, love it!
Omg thank you it works perfectly it bigger than I thought it would be I love it 💖
It's great ! I love it . Only wishing the flim were cheaper .
Good
Awesome and got it fast!
It's great I love it!
Love it!
Absolutely love this camera. Works perfectly. Great pictures, easy to use, and amazing price.
works great, but the description of the condition was not very accurate. there is a black speck- a scratch possibly- on the viewfinder and it is incredibly annoying to have to see everytime you want to take a picture. i can deal with the scratches on the outside because theyre superficial, but something that interferes with the actual pictute taking process is highly irritating.
I just absolutely love it omwh
Takes cute little pictures! I am using it for our guestbook at our wedding. Make sure you know that it only prints CREDIT CARD sized photos.
Cute, classy, fairly compact. Love it! Just be careful inserting film
So fun
I love it!
Love it
Great Product!
i love it :3
I am in love with this camera, I've taken only 4 Polaroids and I gotta say I'm happy. It's completely worth every penny ☺️ I recommend to all those photography lovers!
love it so much!
In love with this camera! So glad that I bought it. If you are debating on if you should buy it or not, I'd say to go ahead and do it! I couldn't be any happier with this purchase. It's cute, takes great pictures, and is the perfect size for on the go. Also, it conveniently comes with the batteries it needs so you don't need to worry about buying some before it arrives. I would recommend this product to anyone!!
Nice camera! Bough it for my daugther she loves it!
My daughter loves this camera and it takes the cutest pictures. Cute, fun, and at a good price on Amazon!
Such a cute little camera! Easy to use and great quality pictures! I only wish they were a little bigger.
Fast Shipping, Everything I thought it would be, Love It.
Love it!!!!
My girlfriend went crazy after I bought her this gift ! She loved it. She always wanted one as a child so I made her dream come true. It's a really neat.
Love it!
Definitely the best thing I've bought in awhile. This camera is not only super easy to use, but the greatest thing to take along when you go on vacations or are just hanging out with friends! Everyone is always so fascinated by it and its great to capture fun memories with. It came just as pictured, and with all the instructions you need. I'd recommend checking out some Youtube tutorials on how to use the camera just in case! But it's super simple to use and to put film in.The camera even turns off if you aren't using it after 5 min. It does come with batteries, which is nice, and they last awhile! <3 It shipped very quickly and arrived in great condition. I'd recommend this product to anyone!
One of the best cameras I have. Takes great photos and brings the 70s back!
This little camera was a gift for my birthday. Once you get the hang of it, it's such a fun party cam! I only use it on special occasions: weddings, parties, travel, things like that. My friends love the pictures - I wish it would print two at a time, since I'm always giving them away :)
Came quickly, works great as promised.
I love mine, thank you
will be fun to use it...
It is an amazing camera the color is actually what it is in the picture. I should also say that if you like taking pictures then this is the camera for you!
Love this camera!
Completely in love with it. Can't  stop using it.
I was really excited about this camera.  The camera is so cute and I thought it would be fun to take snap shots of my 2 year old son for him to cherish later on. It's small enough goes in your purse perfectly, which was another plus for me.Today is the second day I used this camera. It takes good pictures inside.  The photos do have a vintage look to them which I really like. I went to the beach today.  I was so excited to take snap shots of my son on the beach and was so dissapointed when my photos turned out white.  You can see my son but it seems like the photo has been exposed to light and did not come out properly. I will post a picture. I am hoping I can figure out how to take better pictures outdoors. If anyone has any suggestions - please write about it!All in all,  great point and shoot camera.  Not too sure about taking outdoor pictures yet but it's a fun little camera to have around.
Neat, compact remake of the original Polaroid camera.
This product seems like a knock off.  Most of the pictures come out blank in effect It wastes so much film.
I love this camera it takes great pictures. To first start off this review I would like to say that this camera is great its so sleek and pretty skinny and light. The camera looks exactly like the picture. I have dropped this camera before but it was perfectly fine and did`nt get any scratches or anything. From experience always remember to adjust the setting to the one that it suggests (it suggests a setting by lighting up by the setting). Try not to get to close to the camera because i dont if this is just me but when i was too close to the camera i came out very very white. I loved that this came with a cute strap too that matches the camera. I recommend buying a big package of the film because it is very expensive and the more you buy the more money you save. Im not sure but for all of the pictures I have taken so far the flash has been on. Just for when you put in the film box be sure to read the instructions carefully or you will do it wrong and it could mess up the camera. I also recommend getting the color lens. With the color lens on the camera , i think that the picture comes out more cool looking and it looks very tumblry. A great feature on this camera that i love is that it shows you a number which mean how many films you have left. The camera holds ten films at a time. This camera is perfect for creating cute memorys with your friends! The only thing that i would complain about this camera is that the fact that the film for it is so expensive. But i do get why because they are so cute and it prints out write there when you take it. Another thing just make sure you are ready for the picture to be taken because i wouldnt want to waste any of the film. I would totally recommend this as a gift for anyone i love mine! If this review helped you in any way please vote helpful! If you have any questions feel free to ask.
exactly as described and so much fun!
Arrived on time, as described, perfect condition, new with original packaging
I like it alot
Grandaughter loves this.
Cute camera & perfect gift
Even with digital cameras its great to see your picture printed instantly.  Great fun, gave the  camera to my granddaughter for her birthday, she loves it !
Sorry, this product is cheaply made and mine never worked right out of the package.
The camera is bulky, but great for kids! I bought this for my 6 year old daughter and she absolutely LOVES it! The picture quality if surprisingly clear and very easy to use. Highly recommended for any age!
Cute camera, brings back the memories of my old Polaroid camera. Pictures are quite small but great for decoration.
awesome
I purchased this for my wedding shower. HUGE hit! Great price and I LOVE it! :)
Great camera! I know this is just a fad, but it has been fun taking polaroid type pictures again and this camera does a good job at it. Definitely recommend it.
this camera never worked. I got this for my daughter's birthday. It never worked but she tried to work this out so it took a while for her to let me know that this wasn't working. maybe we got defected item but too late to return now. it was total waste of money.
A play-toy; and not even a good play-toy.  I have owned marginally useful instant cameras previously.  I must have been out of my mind to have bought this one.  The slightest movement when snapping the shutter produces a hazy photo, which would be hard to see due to its small size even if it were clear.  I should have sent this back to the seller but didn't.
This is so neat right out of the box me and my daughter started snapping photos! We got a 3 pack of 10 sheets of film in various designs to go with it as well.It's easy to use, fun and a great little party favor to pass out to friends. Love this pink soft shell also.
Super cute & easy to understand! I would definitely recommend purchasing a case for it! :)
Perfect for summer
Came quickly, perfect quality. Love it
Arrived on time and as purchased, daughter loves it!
ok
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas!!! Shipped fast and she loved it!!
Used it for a kids birthday party to provide cute pictures as little take home gifts.  All the kids and parents loved tge pictures.  In this day of digital cameras, people are very pleased to actually be able to hold a printed picture bc so few of us make the effort to print our pictures. I loved the quality and the nostalgia. Really pleased with it.
I have a DSLR, but I wanted to try the Instax cameras out for when I go on vacation to certain locations. I already have the Instax Wide which I adore, but I wanted something smaller that was easier to carry around. While I love how lightweight and small this Instax Mini 8 is, I wish it worked better in direct sunlight. I recently went down the shore and when I tried to use the camera (on the brightest sun setting) to take pictures of the sand dunes, the pictures came out WAY overexposed. It made me waste about 4 films out of 10. The only time it worked was if I was taking a photo of someone DIRECTLY in front of me. I'm hoping it doesn't crap out on me while in Disney next month, or I'll probably have to return it. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes just taking photos for fun! :)
I love it!!
Exactly what I was looking for, and this is MUCH cheaper than I would have paid at Urban Outfitters or any other store!! The pictures come out great (once you learn how to use the flash, that is) and I love the pale yellow shade. Love it!
I love it!
Bought this for my sister and she absolutely loves it!
awesome camera really really really reccomend it if your into instant photos! shipped in 2 days came really fast & packaged nicely i love this product . 5 stars!!
Got this for my daughter on her birthday and was able to use it with her friends and they all enjoyed it as part of their party favors...
THIS CAMERA IS TONS OF FUN!!!! we just recently moved and my daughter has definitely gotten a lot of use out of this camera in our new home and also has been a great talking point for making new friends!! Would definitely reccommend
I got the blue one. Very beautiful!
Great, fun camera.  Was a gift for my 11 year old and it has gotten tremendous use and rave reviews.  It is fun for adults to fondly recall our own instant film days.  These pictures are pretty small, about 2x3 inches in size.  Somehow, this does not detract from the shot.  The kids really enjoy the instant gratification.  Parents appreciate the vintage look.  Highly recommend.
Perfect color & easy to use. Takes great pics!
I've been wanting one of these cameras for a long, long time. I've been researching and looking at online videos to find out if it is worth it, and it totally is! I know you may look at the 1 star comments and decide otherwise, but don't do that! It is really fun to use and it is pretty easy to use, I looked up a video on YouTube and learned how to use it and now my pictures come out great! It works perfectly and u should really buy it!
the kid love it . originaly packed
my daughter loves this camera
I love my Instax Fuijifilm camera! I recently went on a trip to Europe and my poloroid pics make for great memories and was so fun and easy to use. Great for all ages and the picture quality is actually pretty decent if set on the correct settings.
Great camera
A cute camera, perfect size and a nice shape for the hand. Sometimes hard to tell how far away you should be, because the viewfinder is more zoomed in than the actual lens. But just a wonderful camera ❤ The wrist strap, however, looks matching in the picture but is actually a darker yellow
It works very well but I put my first pack of film in it and I got 3 pictures out of it and then the rest wouldn't come out so I had to waste almost a completely full pack of film.
I got this for my mother's birthday and she adores it and never misses an opportunity to take a couple of pictures!
Works as described, easy to use but was expecting more. Pictures are ok but there are basically no settings to the camera. There's less tech in this than old polaroid cameras from the 80's. Look through the viewfinder and hope for the best! Too bulky to carry around and not that enough film per cartridge means it has a very limited range of use.
I bought this camera for my daughter and she's in the Navy now and she loves it tells me Dad its an (Old School camera)
So fun!!! Love this adorable camera
If you going to buy a mini  8 instant film buy it here !! worth the price and its a really cool camera I take it to most place and every one always wants a mini picture of them self. I hang up all my mini pictures in a wall in my room it looks cute :)
good! l like 😍😍
Love this camera! Has a very retro feel to it. I wish the pictures printed larger but they are great to put in wallets.
Very cool
I love it... Great price too
It was fast and quick delivery. My daughter loves the camera
I love it
I received the product in a satisfactory manner and before the scheduled time
amazing have used it soon much OBSESSED. so glad I bought it here instead of other places that sell it for $100.
Very good camera. Does everything the advertising says. My daughter loves!
A present for my daughters 11th Bday.  She LOVES it!!!
Love love ❤️
It came two days earlier but... I opened the box and found a black camera. When I ordered a white camera. It worked fine but seriously? I'm fine with black but it could've been a color I hate like yellow or something
This camera is fantastic. Great picture quality, cute color, good texture, comfortable to hold, and it has different settings for different lighting (of which it suggests automatically). It's easy to operate, fun to mess around with, and the pictures make a great addition to the scrapbook I'm working on.
The color is not really raspberry.  I returned it and got a different color
Grandaughter loves this camera
I'mI love with my fujifilm instax
my daughter got this for christmas and its a big hit at my house ...everyone loves it ... totally worth the money ... the film is crazy expensive for it but just buy the bundle packs and they make up for it ... great gift idea
Broght this for my daugther. She love it
Great little camera. Functions exactly as advertised. It has an automatic focus. You can change it, but picture does not turn out as well if you don't. (Indoor, outdoor, the lighting, etc). My daughter and her friends love using their polarid.
Good product
love it
This camera is compact and sturdy. It is really easy to use and I absolutely love it.
Cute camera and very fun!
This camera is a lot of fun. I'm not good about getting pictures printed so this is an easy convenient way to do it. Loading film is easy. The camera is easy to use for even the most gadget-friendly person.Also, the camera itself has gotten me a lot of compliments. People ask me, "Is that really a Polaroid?"Warning: the pictures are small and the pictures don't come out in bright sunlight.
Purchased this for my daughter, and she loves it! Just be aware of the setting of the camera before you snap the picture.
My gf loves it. Brings back memories of the old Polaroid cameras.
It's a little hard to get the hang of as other reviewers have said you can easily waste a lot of film with the light meter not always being so accurate. Also even if the film roll seems empty try again to make sure you used it all up, lost 2 photos when I prematurely opened it up. pros: cute design, and love having tactile photo result. cons: learning curve is costly
This works well for my daughter, I'm not highly impressed with the functionality or quality compared to the old Polaroid cameras, but for the money my kid loves it.
Came in perfectly, looks amazing and take fantastic pictures. Thanks!
my 10 year old loves this gift.  be warned though, the film is expensive
I love it but I wish I had ordered a camera case at the same time because the white scratches very easily.
I bought this as a graduation gift and my friend loves it. It works absolutely perfectly and arrived on time. We have little credit card sized pictures everywhere now!
Thank you so much im extremely satisfied .
Great camera works perfect
Picture quality is not what I expected.
It's fun to have a Polaroid type of camera, however, I found the room needs to be quite well-lit. The pictures print out the size of a credit card which is cute but at the same time is kind of too small. Perhaps I'm just used to the camera size my dad had when I was a kid.
My girlfriend loves it. Perfect gift for your lady.
This camera is a whole lot of fun! I bought this because I wanted to have some actual, physical pictures since lately almost everything is digital.  I also liked the old, Polaroid-like quality that this camera produces, and it really does not disappoint! There are many different settings on the camera so that you can get the perfect picture regardless of the setting.  There really is something fun about getting an instant picture in your hand a few minutes after taking it.I am certainly not a professional photographer, but this camera proved to be a great purchase and I have had a lot of fun with it!
This is really cute and fun to just play with.  I haven't used it all day or at a party yet so I have no idea on the battery life.  They refills of film are kind of pricey but this would make a cute gift for a graduate or newly married couple and if your okay with spending 100 bucks on film, fun for a party. The pictures come out just like polaroid's do, so I'm not sure they've improved on color quality.  Picture quality as far as sharpness does look better than some polaroid's I've seen. I'm going to say I like it with four stars instead of loving it just because of the price point on film and the lack of improvement on color.  My first time using it was a little clunky, but I'm someone who like to dive in and see if I can figure out a product before I read the directions. Loading the film was a no brainer but if you aren't tech or camera savvy, take a moment to read the directions before using.
Bought this for my girlfriend everything is great! Only thing please be aware the films are expensive!
I like it  takes awesome pictures
its ok if you are not into quality
Excellent! It arrived earlier then expected and everyone loves my new camera.  Very pretty color and don't expect the selfie mirror, if you read the description it doesn't state selfie mirror so I knew what I will except when arrived.  The picture isn't the same camera I received but read description before purchase. You won't be disappointed, I love it!
I love this camera so much! Such a great purchase!
I LOVE this camera its sooo gorgeous and fun watching the photos develope. The film will be alittle expensive 2 keep up with but its completely worthhhh it if your lookn to have something to capture memories u can hold ! .
Love my camera! The pictures are great and it's a great value. If you want pictures larger than these--buy the bigger, uglier Fujifilm instant camera. I really prefer this smaller, cuter version though!!
The camera doesn't come with film, but it works wonderfully and the film is pretty cheap!
Love my polotid however it arrived after the GUARANTEED  delivery date overall I like the product
Pictures for the product are misleading. The camera DOES NOT come with the selfie mirror, which was the main reason I ordered red color in this. My gf was really disappointed and we found out that most of the people did not get the selfie mirror. This listing should be changed, I feel cheated.
I bought this or my daughter she absolutely loves it!
Worthless junk. Didn't last three months. Don't waste your money !
Good quality pictures on an easy to use camera. Would purchase again.
gave this camera to my sister as a gift, we used it right away and she was very happy with it. It's a bright yellow and worked perfectly.
As a photography fanatic, I'm always looking for new cameras to mess with and have fun with. Lately I've been very obsessed with film cameras and thought I would try this camera. The vintage feel it gives plus the gratification of immediately having the photo is great appeal. I absolutely love this camera! So smooth and has such a nice feel. Can't get enough of it!
Love it! I love the matte black color and the curves kind of remind me of Toothless from how to train your dragon lol Camera came on time, no scratch no imperfections and good packaging! I got my films at Michaels for $15 per 20 films with 40% coupons.
Just like the old Polaroid just better
bought this for my sister and she loves it. just the film is expensive
Great product!
Didn't come with batteries, so we couldn't use it at the party I bought it for.  I should have checked earlier, but batteries would be a good thing to ship with it.
Fun camera for my 13 year old daughter. She loves being able to take pics with friends and pin them onto her corkboard frames in her room.
We have been testing this camera - using up expensive film - and have not been able to achieve a clear photo in any condition. With good lighting we have tried still life and on body shots and every photo continues to be fuzzy.  Really disappointing.
Best thing I've bought on here. I'm very happy with this camera, it is definitely worth it ❤
Very good works perfect my girlfriend loved it. You kinda have to  make sure you aim precisely and a good distance because the viewing glass isn't so accurate other then that this camera takes good pictures. Very fun so we can keep good memories. :)!
I  just received my camera about a day ago and i'm already obsessed with it. I have taken two pictures so far and they both turned out perfect. The camera came very fast and in perfect condition. I am very happy with this purchase, this camera is easy to use and looks very cute. The only complain that I have is that the film is a bit pricey but, it is so worth it.
love this camera. It does exactly what I needed.
Granddaughter (13) LUVS this camera, along with her Go-Pro camera!!!!Shipped Fast; Exactly as Described; Great Value!
everybody loves it!
I absolutely love it!!!!!!!! It's so cute!
I love it. It's so compact and easy to carry. I bring it with me everywhere. It takes good photos!
lo ame!
Favorite thing in the world 
Love this camera this was for my granddaughter she asked for it specifically She loved it I made her take the first pic of me and her little sister so she will always remember who she received it from grandma It worked great
Works very well!! I love it and use it when I go on trips or hang out with friends
Very satisfactory
I love this little camera! It shipped on time and was packaged very carefully.First impression: very classy and cute. Almost looks like a toy.Granted the instructions were in Japanese or Chinese (not sure which one), the pictures really helped me figure out what to do. It's all very easy to set up and works flawlessly. However I should warn you that the pics are smaller than expected and in bright daylight the picture doesn't develop as well but other than that, it's pretty neat. I would recommend buying this if you're like going travelling and wanna take some pocket-sized photos.NB: It's continued to work after 3 pictures (I mention this because some reviews mention how after 3 pics the camera just stops)
broke 2nd week I got it
Great!!!
Great little camera, easy for kids to use, and fun
My daughter loves her new camera and she has PLENTY of film (I bought her 160 pictures for her 16th birthday). She loves to have that instant picture as opposed to the pictures on her phone.
Enjoying this camera.... Super cute small, tiny pics!!
that's sooooo good!
I'm upset because it dident come with film, so ended up spending another 15$, which I could have just bought a Polaroid on here for $80 with the film and Polaroid that way I wouldn't have to wait another week for my film to come. But other then that, it works great and fast shipping! Came in 3 days!
Great stuff
Doesn't work 100% :@
Good
Great camera except film's expensive
Câmera is awesome.Haters gonna hate!
Works GREAT! Pictures are surprisingly clear and a perfect size for selfies! The film is expensive (about $1.07) per picture, but the camera is excellent for kids because it is fairly durable (so far) and very easy to use.
Super cute and I always get question on what kind of camera it is
Great!
LOVE
I really like the camara but I think it should come with film.
Love it!
My daugthers love her new camera. No issues and quick delivery.
Either we have a defective camera or you literally need the sun to be hitting you. This pictures simply will not show if the sunlight isn't facing you perfectly.
I love the camera it's everything I wanted & it came at a reasonable time!
I love this fun little camera!!
Great product. Simple and easy to use
The coolest camera ever! My favorite amazon purchase. Takes the cutest photos with a vintage feel. I love using it when I go out with friends. It does seem to have some difficulty with reflections on glass and the film is kindof expensive. But the pros definitely outweigh the cons! 100% recommend.
A little big, be sure to buy Pink for a Girl! But very much loved by my Grand-daughter.
I love love love it!!
My sister loves it just wish that it could hold more shots, but other than that it's great and super sturdy for her accidental drops and bumps.
Ordered the film and camera for my wedding, product arrived on time and was exactly what I wanted.
great product..daughter loves it
I was sent the order twice and the selfie mirror was not included both times. Slightly disappointing but wonderful working camera.
Great camera, i bought it for my sister and she loved it
Just like I imagined it. Love it!
Cute cool fun camera
I loved it !
I got the package early in the morning 2 days after ordering and everything works great. I was a bit hesitant to try it out because of some of the review about it not working right or the flash not working but there was no problems for me. I've taken almost 10 pictures already and the photos are processing fast and good, sure the picture isn't High Def. but it's an instant camera and the price is quite low for this type of pictures. I like the vintage look when the photos are done processing.
Great camera
I bought this for my sister's wedding and it is a fun camera to use. I don't see us using it all the time, because the film is rather pricey, but for special occasions, it is great.
Very cute instant camera! It was smaller than I expected but that made it easier to find a bag for it.
This was a great gift but more expensive when compared to ones I saw afterwards in a store.
Best thing ever!!!😍💖
Almost cancel the order after reading some of the previous reviews.  Glad I didn't...I bought it for my daughter's 10th birthday and she was ecstatic!  Picture quality amazing...
my daughter likes pics are not that great but she seems to like it...
Received it pretty fast, its easy to use, and it's everything I expected it to be :)
I love the color of the camera; it's easy to operate.  I just wish the colors were deeper ~ but it could be my room lighting
Cool camera, I got a few compliments on it- most people were surprised that it was instant film. It's fun as a scrapbook or travel journal camera and the pictures were pretty clear. Minimal settings so you just point and shoot. One of the bad things is there is no timer and taking 'selifes' or close-ups takes some practice because the viewfinder is off from the actual lens. It's a nice little camera as a collection piece or for people who want something fun and simple. As seen in the picture it is an 'off-white' matte color not pure white like the printer paper.
The camera worked really well I wish I had found it earlier.
works great as expected.
the one I bought was new and in good condition, delivered fast and on time, thank you so much..the camera is amazing, it captures precious moments in one instant shot and film. i really really love it! great product!
Great little camera
The camera works well. The viewfinder isn't aligned perfectly so resulting pictures are offset. This instant camera's light settings are a little confusing. However, a nice purchase, overall.
Its a pretty nice camera for special moment. Its not a professional camera. The only bad thing is that there is no automatic exposure option
It was perfect for my daughter.  She is still learning how to change the light settings but very nice.
Very good camera to have it you want your pictures right away.
So fun to use! Good photo quality. I love how every one is unique!
Love it
Good!
Fun and good easy to use camera. Huge hit for a baby shower!!!
Got this for my niece on her 16th bday and she was so happy. Works great and is amazing at catching those special memories you want to cherish forever.
Bought this for my daughters 13th birthday.  She absolutely loves this!
Exactly as described... Quick delivery
Stopped working after two weeks
Love it!
Love it!
Came fast takes great pictures
Good
gf loves it
I have seen these all over Pinterest so I bought one for a family party. It does not come with film you have to buy that separately and it can be a little expensive (I mean who really buys film anymore anyway?). The shipping was pretty quick. I saw the same Camera for about $20 more at Michaels so this was a pretty good deal. When you first get the camera it is a little trial and error. I am so used to using my iphone as a camera that looking through a lens confused me. It has a very small viewer so you have to be careful your finger doesn't cover it. Once you get a hang of it it is pretty fun but it will take you a couple of tries. The whole anticipation is for when the pictures come out. It is so old school and that is half the fun. The picture quality is as best that can be expected for a mini instant camera and the pictures are fairly tiny. The finish of the picture tends to be a little washed out but then again you are not using this camera for high quality photography more like a novelty. The pictures have a little tab at the bottom that that you can use a Sharpie to write messages on.
Bought this for my granddaughter's birthday and she has had so much fun with it..  Now to keep her in film is another story.
It was erevything perfect! Amazing product.
I love it! And it's lighter to hold than I expected
I've been dying to get one and kept on wondering if I should or not. And I'm glad I did! The pictures are really vibrant and crisp. Love it!EDITmmm... REALLY wish I got a different color...the Yellow one was definitely not my first choice. I wanted the Raspberry one, but it wasn't offered at the time I decide to splurge. And of course, they come out and offer that color the week after I got my camera. The thing about the yellow one, is that it scratched a lot. You can usually rub it off, but the small hits against a zipper, other things inside the bad and more, makes the exterior of the camera really ugly and dirty.The camera's still awesome and I love it, so no stars to take away. But the color, 👎👎😟UPDATE 8/16/2016The dial doesn't seem to change the setting anymore.. It's a hit or miss on how the photos will turn out. The film counter's also off and keeps on telling me I have film when I don't, or don't have film when I do. It's very bizarre.
I absoluely love the camera. Thank you for it. It's so beautiful and I use it all the time!!
My daughter loves it!!!
Excellent!
I kept debating on which I should get, the Instax, the Polaroid or the Instax printer for smartphones. It came in today and I'm in love with it. I've only taken 3 photos indoors so far and they came out great. My 8 year old took the photo of our dog and she had no problems using it. I was so happy to see that it takes a few seconds for the photo to develop just like the old ones did. I think the size of the photos are cute and NOT too small. I went with this brand mostly because I wanted the look of the original Polaroid film with the white boarder. Next on my list will be the Instax printer so I can print pictures that are on my phone. Very happy with the product. Going to Lake Winnie tomorrow and can't wait to try the different settings and see how they turn out!
Absolutely love this productIt performs really well in all lighting - just make sure to change the aperture for the different lighting settings you're inIt fits perfectly in my hand and even came with a cute polka dot strap
This camera is so pretty. The photos don't come out absolutely clear so they have a vintage feel. I love it. It is the perfect size.
AMAZING PRODUCT♡♡
What a great camera! Takes really cute pictures that are ready to go straight in the wallet or a fun framed look. Loved the quality and the look.
I love this camera! It's perfect if you like to keep it old fashioned! I personally like having pictures displayed on my wall. Still own a great film camera just so I can develop my pictures and have them for memories! Their are cons...the pictures are very small if you'd like them bigger I recommended getting the wide instant camera. The functions I still can not understand because instructions are in Chinese. Lastly, film is very pricey so point and shoot responsibly!!!!Will be purchasing wide instant camera. 😊
love this s***
great camera for instant gratification.  we take lots of pics but they get lost on computers, flash drives, and SDcards.  My daughter asked for this for her 12th birthday and really loves it.  Only complaint I have is the size of the pics.  They are definitely smaller that the ones I remember from my childhood.
LOVE THISSSSSS
I wish the film was a little less expensive but I LOVE THIS CAMERA
It's Great! Just as described and we love it!
👍
All was ok, it was that I Bought.I recomend this seller!!
The camera is in perfect quality. The pictures have a beautiful vintage quality to them. I highly recommend!
love, love, love this camera
Got this as a gift for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved it! It's a great product.
I love this camera so much, I use it all the time.
This is awesome! It's cute and I'm gonna decorate my room with the pictures I take with it. It's super fun to play with!
This camera works great!I bought mine from Roberts LP and will continue buying whatever I can from them.Sadly my sister wanted the camera so I decided I'm going to try to buy a new one in a different color hopefully they it works the same!
Ships fast and item as described. Not too many options, so very easy to use.
This is so much fun!
I absolutely love it and it was delivered so fast!
I had the mini 7 before and this camera is much lighter. It makes it easier when carrying it in a bag. It's also a bit smaller than the mini 7. The film is the same making it easy as I didn't have to buy new film for this camera. It's a simple camera that anyone can use.
I got the camera on time. I've been using it and it's amazing I love it so much I'm so glad I made the choice of purchasing this camera!
Love It ❤️
I wasn't really sure about getting the camera but I'm glad i did. Everyone in my family loves it. It's great!
My daughter loves it & so does her brother, who wants his own.
In love with this little thing!
What was once outdated, is now again popular. The 16-year-old LOVES this thing. And it takes good pictures!
IN MARCH I ORDERED THE CAMERA AND THE ACCESSORIES FOR MY DAUGTHER'S BD IN JUNE. IT CAME VERY FAST AND WAS HIDDEN AT HOME FOR TWO MONTHS. I COULDN'T WAIT TO SEE IF SHE'S GONNA LIKE IT AND HOW ARE THE PIC. SHE LOVE IT. THE PICTURES ARE VERY CLEAR...A+ A+++BUY IT! WITH THIS PRODUCT AND ITS PRICE EVERYTHING IS A+
Ok, before I buy this product I made sure to read the reviews, but the only bad thing is that they said had no mirror selfie, then contact these sellers (6 to be specified) and no sellers had the product selfie mirror. and the question is that this was limited and only Japanese or Chinese sellers have products that seek time.I'm happy with the color and the product, to be honest I love my instax and not complicate my life! just buy a mirror selfie. ;) #behappy
Really love this!
ordered wrong camera. now to late to return it.
I bought it for my girlfriend and she was very happy. The camera is exactly as illustrated arrived in very good conditions and I bought it with 1-Day Shipping.
Camera is nice shade of red. No mirror selfie, but I bought one anyways. It works like a charm, people love it and so do I.
Love this product! Super cute and fun! It's a nice way to keep memories. You should buy it!!!!
Got this as a Mother's Day gift & I love it so much. Btw you have to buy the film separately as it doesn't come with any but it's only about $1/print so it's cheap!
Takes great pictures, just wish they were a tad larger.
The camera is very cute! Also user friendly! My daughter love's it!!
Purchased for my daughter's birthday. She loved it.
I am a VERY dissatisfied customer.  I purchased a Fuji camera for my daughter.  It was over the warranty provided by Amazon that we used the camera and discovered it did not work correctly. She was unable to take pictures with the camera outside (the pictures came out fine indoors). I sent the camera back to have it replaced or repaired. The camera was returned to me in the same condition and still was not working correctly.  I called Fuji and was told there was nothing else they could do by an employee that did not seem to have any understanding of how the camera operates.  Poor Fuji customer service.
Very good and easy to use it
I LOVE THIS CAMERA! too cute! and makes great memories with friends!! LOVE THIS!!!
Love, love, love it!!!
I love it
Love the camera. Its soo cute and easy to use and easy to take with u (if u bought the case for the camera), also love the film that comes out right after taking the photo. Film not included. Have to buy everything separate from the camera.
Received on time and according to advertised.
My best friend loved it
I got this for my daughter on her birthday and she absolutely loves it. It is so easy and simple. She already has old things like a type writer, record player and more so I knew she would love it!
First day of use I'm already obsessed! The pictures comes out so clear and gives you that old school feel when Polaroids first came out. You will have alot of fun with this and it will not stop.
My wife love this, picture quality is good and it is not very expensive.
Awesome color yellowTrue to toneAwesone revamped camera from the good old original7 year old loves it!
Polaroids are back!  Cool camera fun memories.
As expected.
great product.
This camera is so sleek. I really love the picture quality. It arrived just today, and I purchased it yesterday. I will have updates soon, with pictures to show. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for a lightweight, high quality instant capturing camera.
Fun, fun, fun, grand kids love it.
good quality a little expensive
Its really works
Takes amazing pictures. Super cute and easy to carry around with you.
Every photo I take comes out as overexposed. I know for a fact it is not because of my own photo taking abilities. I've done a lot of research and think this might be a cheap, knockoff camera from the real brand. I highly suggest spending more money to get it from a reliable source instead of spending less on this one, and wishing you hadn't bought it at all.
great camera. Film is pricey
Kind of a late review for this but I still ABSOLUTELY LOVE this camera. Its so easy to carry around in my bag and the films can be a bit pricey at times but it still remains a good memory to keep. I decorated mine with full of stickers and it was adorable.
It was a gift and it is well loved and enjoyed.
Girlfriend loves this!
I can only say that I love it... Would totally recommend it .
Only reason why I got this color was for the built-in selfie mirror, which this shipped without. Overall, still the great Instax Mini 8, simply disappointing that I was misled.
Received it great price point everything was on point but after getting the camera it was disappointing it wasn't what I expected but that has nothing to do with the seller just the camera itself is not of great quality so it's just itself a prop in my photos
This is my first Polaroid and I love it! It works perfectly! None of my pictures came out overly bright or dark. And it's the easiest thing to use. (I have other cameras). I took it to the bowling alley and the pics look really 70s, it's awesome! Overall, it's a great camera! A little pricey but great buy!
Ok
So much fun!  Bought this camera for my daughter for her 13th birthday and she couldn't be happier!  Easy to carry,  easy to use. She can hardly put it down!
I love this little camera. Super fun to use at parties... a little bulky to travel with though
Ive always wanted one and i just received mine today! I took 3 pictures and all came out with amazing lighting and quality can't wait to use it this summer definitely worth the money.It was packed very safely and came very quickly.I recommend it to anyone.Very happy with my purchase.
My 13 year old loves this camera. Loves to take it with her where ever she goes. Totally a big hit, Can't go wrong buying this!
completely satisfied!
LOVE it! Ordered it for a family vacation in mexico and it was so fun to print out pictures immediately and have that vintage look. Sometimes when there was too much light the picture would over expose and the picture would be ruined :/, it's my fault but just be careful for that! Otherwise, I love it!
Im obsessed with taking pictures now lol. It's a very nice camera to use on the go, and its also too cute not to use 😉.
Super fun little party camera. Definitely a novelty; these are not pics you're going to do much with afterwards.  Flash goes off every time automatically but unless you're super close to your subject,  it comes out way dark.
Love it
Absolutely awesome, took this to Africa, and was so nice to give something like a photo instead of them giving...buy it!!  This woman in Samburu village had never really seen herself..beautiful...she's holding the photo I took with this camera!
I bought this for my daughter's 10 birthday and she loves it! We also got the case to protect it. Fun, fun, fun.
Love, Love this camera! Can't say enough about it. I think it's something everyone should own. They print out the cutest little pictures right away in seconds. Good quality too!
Purchased as gift for 16 year old girl. She's happy with it. It arrived early from China.
This is an awesome camera. Easy to use, and came early!
Works fine.
I think I'm going to love it but have not used yet.  I bought to take on a mission trip to South Sudan so I can put the children's name with the picture.  I need to get more film so I can try it out.  Great color.
Great polaroid camera! Took a lot of pictures with it when I travel around - but sometimes the films get stuck and never comes out. I turned out had to remove the whole pack and all those new films were wasted
Good price but shipping did seem like a long time. Product came safe and sound love my fujifilm :)
This was the life of the party! Im so happy I bought this
Works as intended. Bought for gift for grandson. He loves it.
So cute and amazing! Picture quality comes out well!
The camera produces good quality pictures.
Takes great photos for a instant photo camera. Wish it can hold more film.
I purchased this for my daughter's 12th birthday and she loves it!
Great
Came in just in time and everything came in tact and all the film were all inside as well
The packaging is really cute. It also comes with a safety wrist holder thing, this product is easy to use and pretty user friendly for individuals like me who are amateurs with polaroid cameras. The only con is that when you go outside on a SUNNY/ bright day make sure to turn the light exposure to the "Hi-Key" setting or your pictures will have too much exposure and you'll waste a film. All in all I am very satisfied with it.
I just bought this camera for my daughter to take to college and she absolutely loves it! Her first attempt at using the camera did not turn out well as she tried to take a picture of herself in the mirror and the flash went off. So far the flash has gone off every time (indoor and outdoor on a cloudy day). I am writing a review simply to advise others to not attempt to take mirror selfies as you will simply be wasting film! Also, I suggest you keep the owners manual and quickly scan the english instructions before using the camera for the first time as they were extremely helpful now and will continue to be helpful in the future.
Love it !
My favorite purchase this summer! So fun and easy to use.
This is super cute and very easy to use! We plan on using it for our guest book for our wedding and I think I will need to label the power button and the shutter button but other than that its very simple. Also the photos come out awesome!
Arrived on time, easy to get started, works perfectly!
So glad that i splurged and got this for myself. I love taking photos of my family and having the picture pop out right away. So much fun.
Cute, fun camera.  Pictures small, tho.
It wasn't all I thought it was. Takes pretty bad photos and doesn't even work properly. Kind of a waste of money when you have a cell phone to take good photos with
Not the best quality pictures but fun to have.
I love my camera ! It's cute and handy ! Very fun to take pictures ! And the picture quality is surprisingly very good ! Would recommend if you want cute Polaroid pictures !
check the pictures!! Although it's a new one, I could only take one good picture before it stopped working!!
Im in love, it was just what I want, Its fun, Its so good for those moments you want to save or give to someone, its really nice and simple to use. I really love my new toy!  the pictures have a perfect size (like a credit card size) and its really nice to open a conversation... hope you like it and enjoy it! (( ohhh the yellow is like a pastel yellow... but it so cute! ))
Film sheets are pretty pricey...
Absolutely love this product!! Such a fun way to capture moments, only down fall is the film is pretty expensive so you really have to use it wisely!
Luv luv luv this camera!! Very happy with purchase and seller. :)
My graham daughter loves it.
Bought for 10 year old and they loved it.  Having a lot of fun snapping pictures.  Pictures are clear and although they are smaller than the original instant cameras it is still fun to get the picture right away and see it develop.  Very happy with the purchase.
12 year old granddaughter loves the camera
My new toy! I brought this with me to my grandaughter's kindergarten graduation. The pictures turn out great. All her friends wanted me to take their pictures. They were thrilled to go home with one!
Bought for my 13-year-old granddaughter for her birthday!  She absolutely loves it.
Love it!! It's so perfect! Thank you so much! I recommend this to everyone who wants something vintage yet with a modern twist. Definitely something worth investing in!
the sitting on the camera doesn't change by itself, when i was in the house the red light shows me that i should use the house for take a pic, when the picture come out it was too bright, when i was outside, the red light still shows that i should use house for take pic, when the pic come out it was too dark. I hate this camera. the light doesn't change every time it came out some ugly pictures.
Bought this for my daughter, she is absolutely in love with it.
Awesome
My wife loves it! The pictures actually look awesome! It has an old school feel like the old Polaroids I have in my photo album. My only advice is to take the photos pretty close as portraits so you can fill the frame. The picture frames are long and narrow. Fun camera though! Have fun!
Received my camera today! I love it lol. I remember I didn't understand why there was even a white camera but it's actually the cutest one to me. It's the real deal too with the correct "instead mini 80" logo. I keep staring at it and it came with a strap which I didn't know was included.
It's a nice cool camera. The only problem I have is that the number on the back is always on zero, so I don't know how much film I have left.
Although this is the color camera I wanted, like everyone else said there is no selfie mirror on it. I'm not too mad because the camera is so awesome, but they need to change the picture here!!!
Love this camera; lots of fun!  Works great, but getting the exposure right can be tricky. I took this on the beach in bright sunlight and took a picture on the lowest exposure setting and the image was over exposed.  As to be expected with instant film cameras, the quality of the photos is poor, but I feel that's part of the fun!  As long as the exposure is correct and you're not too close to the subject, the subject will be in focus.  Great little camera, but don't expect it to produce quality photographs.
Delivered quickly.  Takes great pictures.
I gave it to my friend's kids as a gift. They loved it. It is very easy to use and very cute. I loved pink color.
Great purchase! I love it!!!!!
It's exactly what I ordered and wanted! It's so cute, and so happy to finally have it.
my daughter loves it.
I am very disappointed in the product. First, the picture is so very small. I don't remember reading anywhere in the literature that the size was so tiny. Second, the quality of the picture is indistinct -- no detail, even in close-ups. The light seems right on the setting I used, though. On the plus side -- it is easy to use, although it would be nice to have written instructions along with the pictures.  I would not buy this product again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else.
Granddaughter loves it. Everything was what it advertised.
CUTEST THING I'VE EVER BOUGHT EVER!!!! Working fine!! I wish I could give this 10 stars. Plus, best price. No chance I would've paid 100 dollars at urban outfitters! I love it! Definitely recommend it! Worth every penny
Really happy with this purchase. I've always wanted a instant camera and now I have one. Great for making memories. Came in perfect condition. Don't even think twice about this bc it's amazing.
Exactly the way it was described
I received my camera in perfect condition promptly on the expected delivery date! As long as you make sure not to expose the film after you've installed it and use the recommended setting, this takes pretty good pictures! I like that the photos are clear while still having a retro look. The film is rather expensive, so you wouldn't want to get too snap happy with it but it's great for special occasions, vacations, or being out with friends and family.One thing that could be negative for some buyers is that the camera I received did not come with a "limited edition selfie mirror" as advertised in the description. This could have to do with which seller fulfills your order though. Mine was through Good Luck Bargains. I'm still giving 5 stars though because I chose this camera for the color rather than the mirror. Overall a great purchase that I'm looking forward to using!
I just got this camera about 2 weeks ago and every pic I have taken is either too dark or blown out white. I follow the suggestion on the lighting and they all look terrible! Can someone help?
The best camera! Such a party hit and takes great quality pictures.
Love it
I LOVE this camera!! I've had it for about 2 months now and have taken about 50 pictures. Only 1 came out too dark but I think it had more to do with the sunlight and not the camera though. Great investment for instant memories.
In love!
Great
It's good!!

Bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loved it!! Polaroid still rocks in this digital age.
no selfie mirror as other reviews mentioned.  I wasn't as disappointed since I read previous reviews but that's still unfair to advertise as such. Overall camera takes good pictures-  still learning the settings as some pictures some out too dark or too light.
really nice camera!!
Bought as a gift for a 15 year old.  Loves it!  No end of fun taking pictures.The camera is very light and sturdier than it appears to be.Have experienced no problems with photo quality.
Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she has beyond loved it. It works without a problem and is very easy to use. Overall a great Polaroid camera and I would gladly recommend it!
I love this camera. Strated showing it off and now everyone of y cousins and aunts are buying it. Great to capture memories which are created everyday.
Daughter loved it. The pictures are clear and smaller than the old Polaroids - wallet sized. She had fun getting instant pix of friends at a party.
Works great!
This is one of the most fun cameras I have ever used (and I have used the original polaroids from way back).  The pictures are very small but you can capture a lot on such a small frame.  I get this camera out at family gatherings and give the photos away as people are leaving.  Often when I visit their houses, I see those photos on display up on their refrigerators and bulletin boards!
TOTALLY LOVE THE CAMERA!!! 100% brand new and easy to use. It also came super fast, I got it like 4 days after placed the order. True color just like in the pictures. I recommend this :)))
This camera is small and easy to carry around. I love the pictures that come out! However, remember that this is a mini so the pictures come out smaller than normal Polaroid pictures. I love my camera so far and have had no issues with it!
Hi, I am very unhappy with this seller.The product is OK, it is what you can expect from an instant film camera. But mine looks really old, like it had been stored for 7 years or more, it has some pen marks and it has some dust. When I rotate the focus lens it sounds like it has some dust and is rusty inside, pretty much like having a chicken inside it. Also the box looks like used, it came with some hair strings inside it and finally there is a label over and old label, so it seems like it was reselled. Completely not a new item.
Another thing that I bought for my daughter's 15th birthday, aside from the film being a bit costly she loves it!
the pictures were so much smaller than I was expecting, and for a 'mini' camera, its actually awkward and larger than a digital one
It is a great camera and the color is very very nice. I loved it! It was love at first sight. Don't be fooled by the selfie mirror... it does not come with it , but to be honest I don't think it is needed. This camera is amazing just how it is and I will definitely recommend anyone to buy it. I'm so in love!!!
This little camera is great fun!  It takes clear pictures of people and is perfect for what we need.
Easy to go camera for instant developed pictures.
good product, great price
very good product
My son, in high school LOVES it!
I love the size of it and the colour! It works well in cloudy weather and indoors!
Instant fun
Love It
Awesome!
it was intended as a gift for a child moving up her school career. it was received with great anticipation. I imagine it works well as I have not received any complaints; just salutations and kind words. thank you for making this possible.
this camera is so easy to use and so much fun.  it's nice to have photos print automatically, and write messages on the bottom.100% get it!
So in love. I think it's worth every dollar. I've taken some shots already and they have come out great. It was delivered to my job and so everyone was super excited to take pictures with it and loved it! I'm so pleased!
Just by luck, I've bought the package for the strap mainly. Camera has NO FILM . Seller should have made a note to buyer. Warning. Very Deceptive.
as described
So much fun!!  I love this camera!!
I love it
Sucks ass! It broke down by itself flash stopped working therefore camera is useless.
My 14 year old daughter loves this camera! The instant pictures are a hit at her gatherings! Quality is not great but the kids don't care - they love watching the pictures develop. Just a fun item!
Love love love it. Fits perfectly in my purse arrived quickly and heads up DONT SHAKE THE PHOTO!! That's where the negative reviews for ink running are coming from. Quit that.
My little one love it!
Who would have known that this would make a comeback? I didn't either. I bought it for my girlfriend and she loved it. Her and I both use it whenever we go out with a bunch of friends. It's very convenient when we take a groupie (group selfie). Because of its capability to instantly print out photos, Fujifulm instax film camera made it my to-go camera every time I go out. The sad part is that I never have a copy for myself since everyone always wants a copy. Here is my review after 6 months of usage:Usability: 9/10Plug and playAffordability: 6/10I remember when cameras like these were less than $50 back in the day, the 90's.Convenience: 9/10This camera definitely makes a great gift if you are planning to buy it for a friend, girlfriend, white-elephant or even for nostalgic value. You will definitely have a lot of fun and get noticed.
This camera is awesome! Not only is it perfectly priced, but so is the film (you have to buy this separately). There's a variety of accessories you can get with this camera, such as stickers, cases, selfie-mirrors, the list goes on. This camera came in on-time with my selection of the FREE 2-Day Shipping. The only down side is that most of the writing in the papers that come with the camera are in a language that isn't english. There is a photo description on how to use it and how to put the film into the camera, not to mention that you can take around 100 photos with the same batteries.Overall, this camera is definitely a great product; it's a must have!(I would not recommend this product for children under 10 years of age, due to the price of the camera, and the specifics needed to do to take a photo. Also, the film is cheap, but a child of this age or under may run through the film much faster, and would waste it.)
Makes for a great nostalgic gift. The pictures are small, smaller than a Polaroid used to be but the technology is similar, it's easy to use and makes for a fun gift!It's very Point and Shoot and the pictures look good. Almost like they have an Instagram Filter.
I love it
Bought it as a birthday present, made a great gift and the birthday girl loved it.
Absolutely LOVE IT!!!!
I bought one for me and I love to play with the camera and I bought one as a gift for my friend. She also loved!!
the product is wonderful! it was packaged in a very secure manner. However, I do have one problem with the camera itself. When i change the lighting setting, the light that indicates which mode you are on does not switch. I cannot tell if it is working or not :/
This is a cute camera. I love that it takes a few min and then you have the picture! One thing that I figured out from reading other reviews is that it suggests the setting your in when you turn the camera on by a small orange light however you can choose whatever setting you would like. Its very easy to use and pretty lightweight as well. One down side to bringing this to events and parties is that people are going to want the pictures that you take!
well functioning product
If you are buying it just bc it comes with the selfie mirror or attracted by limited edition, this product is gonna disappoint you! I read the review and I wasn't sure until I receive it. Yea no selfie mirror whatsoever.
I really like it.
My granddaughter loves it,,, perfect for younger kids for sure
Very fun and works well. However film is in my opinion expensive.
Nice and fun for a gift, but not the best way to store memories
i loved loved loved this Polaroid camera so convenient !! i had it for over a year now i gave it to my sister since she loved it too i like the quality of the pictures as well totally want the wider version of this too!!!
Had this for almost a year and got it as a personal bday gift to myself. Honestly the best little machine to carry around and to parties. Blows peoples minds!
It is easy to work. It is so awesome when u r creating a photo book. I love it
It came in really fast I love it!! It also came a week earlier!! All of my friends got them too cause they love taken pictures!!
This was gift for my daughter in law. She loves it. So easy to use. Great quality of pictures.
Great product. I like it. Thumbs up!
Love this camera. No complaints.
Fun little camera! A cute gift idea!
Showed up in time and works great!
Wife loves it for our little ones pics so much fun!
I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE my Instax Mini.  Great price from Amazon, and I use this camera ALL THE TIME.  So many other people have also fallen in love with my camera and have wanted to purchase their own.  It is honestly one of my all-time favourite purchases <3
Just perfect!!! So cute and useful
Good deal, what I expected, delivered timely.
I absolutely love the camera! So satisfied with the photos I took, it works perfectly.BUT it's NOT as red as it seems. I'd say it's actually PINK. Got really disappointed about that, but overall, Instax Mini 8 is amazing.
My daughter got this 2 years ago, she still takes pictures with it all the time. Great gift for teens!
Really fun and really cute. A little bulky since we have all gotten used to tiny cameras, but it heist we love it.
I wish the color was whiter, it is a slight creamy white color. But it takes great pictures and it is easy to use. :)
Very good product and seller. Trust!
I bought this as a gift for my 8 year old niece. Yes there are a few functions but after an explanation from my sister on how to use it she's using it with ease. There are super cute film packs available for this camera with cute designs my niece liked. It's a nice throwback to Polaroids and the instant gratification of the picture is such a thrill for her (and me!). Awesome little camera.
It got delivered earlier than expected which is always good. It was just how i expected it to be very cute and easy to use.
This camera is really cute. I love it.
absolutely IN LOVE with my new toy :). Easy to use. Great pics. lots of fun.
Great for shots up close. I purchased to use at school for the kids to have pictures right away. The kids love it! The quality of the pictures is about what you expect from a Polaroid. The film can get expensive fast especially if you are used to taking lots of shots on a digital camera.
Too old school.  Pictures are poor quality.
When finally wanted to use the camera realized  it was missing the pictures.
Purchased for my 7 year old son. He absolutely loves it. Great old skool product with modern day technology. Pictures print right away. It's really cool to look at the picture as it develops. Fun and light weight. Seems durable as well. Happy customer.
best purchase ever
My daughters, ages 11 and 13, were so thrilled about this camera.  It takes some practice to shoot these right and unfortunately, the film is pricey, but worth it to get a unique experience.  It is fun and fairly easy.  I got them each one, and they could choose their favorite color which made it more fun.
Surprised that it takes decent photos
Great products.
Item delivered on time, was as described...Excellent!
I love my instax mini!
Awesome product i enjoy taking pictures with some close friends and girlfriend that perfectly fits in your wallet... I'm a person who travels a lot around America (south & north) and these small pictures let me take some owesome moments with me... Also girls feel really attracted to these stuff (they love pictures) xD
Girlfriend loved it! Thanks guys.
excellent purchase.  great birthday present.
My daughter loves this camera, im getting one for my nephew as well!
Great item arrived in time
very good
Perfect. Everything I expected.
Just be careful if you take pictures outside in the summer because your pictures could get over-developed in the heat. Otherwise it's great after you figure it out.
The camera is a lot lighter than I expected which is great because I'll be taking it to Thailand, love how a set of batteries came with it, but I didn't know the film wouldn't come so I'll have to buy that but its a great product! Thank you!
AMAZING! Came in great time, and packaged very well.
my 12yr old grand daughter absolutely loved receiving this camera for her birthday and had so much fun using it at her birthday sleepover party.
This camera is awesome! It's so easy to use and takes great pictures. I love it! The color is spot on. It's just perfect and cute.
Loved it!! Its the perfect gift
Good
love it ! Its definitely worth getting but if you could invest for a intax mini 90, you should get that one instead.I'm overall happy with what I got except I'd like to take photos on a nice sunny day and the film turns out either too bright or completely white because its way to bright outside. I say a good photo would be from a " home" to a " sunny". not the last tab on the view set buttons.it takes really good vintage looking pictures but not on a bright day where the sun is hitting it.
Fun, cute camera! Purchased this for my 12-year-old daughter as a Christmas present as she had placed it on her wish list. Takes fun mini Polaroid pics that remind me of my youth. ;) She loves taking it to sleepovers.
My daughter loves her camera.
Oh my goodness. Where do I start with this camera. I have been looking online for the past three months in search of an Instax Mini 8. I visited Urban Outfitters, seeing that their cameras were over 100 dollars! The same goes for Michael's. Even EBay had expensive cameras ranging (for a new camera) from 80-100 dollars. When I found this camera, the fact that it was only $69 was shocking. I love it so much. All of my expectations that I had been building up from the videos and reviews on it were actually true! I also recommend 100% buying the film on Amazon too, because places other than Amazon are very overpriced, and can be roughly a dollar per picture! I bought a 2 pack for only $16!!! I love this camera and recommend it to anyone who was like me and obsessing over it!P.S.....I have friends that have the blue and yellow ones, and my favorite is the pink(:
Great
My daughter absolutely loves it. She takes photography at school and likes to have different mediums (not just digital phone pics).
i loveeeeeeeee it, its really cute and easy to use
Cute as a gadget camera
I bought 2 of these for my wedding for our Photo Guest book. Took a few trial photos and they look great so far, however I am really into vintage looking pictures so if you are looking for sharp clarity you may want something else. These are so fun though and I love them!
i received this camera yesterday and have been snapping away ever since. The pictures are way better quality than I had expected and the use of the camera itself takes me back to the days of Polaroids! I love this camera and would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, good quality instant camera.
Grandaughter loved it
My daughter loves this- so fun for her!
Fun color and I got it on sale.  Works great. Younger kids love seeing their picture appear.
Works great and is a lot of fun!
Got it for my daughters birthday and she loved it.
I got this camera for my wife to use as a casual camera. She uses it often and I love the size of the Polaroids. Very neat!
This one doesn't work even thought I have battery . Why???
This camera is a huge hit among everybody. These aren't very common anymore so it's nice to have one. The quality is great, and I personally like that the pictures come out kind of small. Only negative I have is that the film is rather expensive, but it is worth it to have these hard copies instead of all digital.
i will take this with me one trip every time!
Waste of money, unsatisfied  with the quality of photos it takes, the amount of product to be used
I got the wrong camera color. I ordered the white one but got the blue one.
I bought this camera on Monday and received it in 3 days. I've taken a couple of pictures and they've turned out good. You have to get used to setting the brightness adjustment so that your picture isn't too light or too dark. Overall, I'm pleased with my camera and I'm glad that it shipped quick! This is definitely a 5 star product.
I love it! I was fairly suprised that it delivered so quick to my house. I had the batteries on their wrong side so make sure you put them in correctly or else you'll be like me freaking out why it's not working. Took a test run and it was amazing. It's cute, small and has that grunge effect. Overall happy with this product.
Nice camera and takes great pictures
Such a great price! Comes in the original packaging.
Fun for quick moments, not much control over the images.Dropped it once from 3 1/2 feet in the air and it's done for, so the stability of the design is poor.Getting a Neo Classic instead so I can have more control
Fun and easy to use. Takes great pictures
It's fun but beware, if you buy this, you're going to spend lots on film! but it's fun and cute so...that's what makes it popular, instant picture.
Cute & fun camera, perfect for my 8 year old's journal.
Being new to the instax camera, I thought the film I had was expired. The shutter and settings do not work well, and the camera will spit out a blank piece of film. Very upset that once I realized that it was in fact the camera, I could no longer return it.
Cutest camera ever - and takes really good pictures - very easy to use also.
Bought as a gift and my wife loves it! she uses this more than her iphone to take pictures.
I love my new Polaroid! Although not easy to carry around, it is super cute and pictures have turned out great!
Fantastic. I love the pink color. I wish it wouldn't always use the flash. It's difficult to take outdoor pictures during the day without the photo developing weird.
Great little camera. The color is so cute.
was a gift
Granddaughter just got her package and she is so excited to start taking pictures!
Great camera for my daughter, she loves it
I love the camera, but the film tends to be on the more expensive side.
good product
So much fun
I absolutely love this camera. The only reason I did not rate 5 stars is because no film or batteries come included. The other thing was that the camera is over priced. At Walmart, the same camera in white is about $20 less than this one.
I purchased this camera for my daughter for her sixteenth birthday several months ago.  She really likes the camera and it is small enough that she carries it with her everywhere in her purse.  Her friends all love it when she pulls out the camera, takes a photo and moments later has a picture.  It is fun watching them be so impressed with something old that is new again.  She has taken at least 100 pictures and has not had to replace the batteries yet and the quality of the pictures continues to be the same as the first pictures that she had taken.  The downside is that the film is slightly pricey (around $38 for 50 pictures), so keep that in mind when purchasing the camera.  But, it is worth it to me since she enjoys it so much.  It is also fun to see all the pictures that she has taken and she proudly displays many of them on her desk and nightstand.
Perfect
The way that i expect
This is a great camera, shipping was as told and seller sent them asap, it takes pretty lousy pictures and doesn't focus at all. This is definitely a novelty camera and if you want good pictures with polaroid, i would invest in the neo 90 camera. Overall this is very easy and fun to use, and i really love it. I actually think that the pictures come out better and more vintage looking out of focus. I got it in pink, but it got very old, very quick. Even if you like pink, like i do, get black or white to make sure you will always like it.
excellent
Pictures are more vibrant than I ever could have expected as a photographer.
My daughter loves this camera. It's great. Brings back old memories.
Love the camera. Wish it came with batteries included but still great and super cute!
excellent easy to use fun camera
Can't access the other features for example when your outside or it's super bright outside its stuck on the home selection even thought the outdoor selection on the camera is selected the light won't turn on to confirm. So the pictures are just over blown with too much brightness
I love it!!!
Absolutely love it! It takes great pictures but be mindful of the sun whenever outdoors as photos can turn out with too much light.Easy to load the films and even  easier to use. Item arrived one day after the expected delivery date.
Super cute! I cant wait to start taking pictures!
Really good gift for my girlfriend, and receiving it was really quick!!! It was in perfect form and I recomend you buying here!!
Very happy with this product ....
Not what I expected.  Can't do much with it.
Cute
SO CUUTE
MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT!  HAD IT FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW & IT WORKS GREAT.
I bought this model for the selfie mirror, but it did not come with a selfie mirror. The description clearly stated that it was a limited-edition raspberry instax mini 8 with a selfie mirror. It was disappointing but besides that, it is everything I thought it would be. I really enjoy the color of the camera.
Awesome camera! Love how easy it is to use and the various light settings. Used for my wedding day. The Polaroids are much smaller than the traditional Polaroids I grew up with. Overall though, very happy.
great, easy to use, fun for kids.  too expensive tho!
love it
My 12 year old loves her camera.
My daughter loves this cute camera. Only downsides are the credit card sized prints and their ridiculous price.
This was my daughter's big 10th birthday gift...she loves it and so do her friends and their parents. After whipping through the first pack of film (aka wasting it), she has become more responsible with only taking pictures of things that merit taking a picture.
I love it! Ordered it after seeing another friend use it and wanted my own. Really enjoying the retro pics that we get from it and it's fun seeing everything and just nice to have something more than just a digital copy on my phone or tablet. Have taken it on a trip to Italy and around locally and it's great! Just need to get used to the light settings to get the right look on photos...
Photos not consistent:  frequent blank or black photos (more than 50% wasted!!)  Batteries seem to run out very quickly.  Disappointed.  Cute but not recommended  : (
i love it, its fast a bit tiny but overall i love it.
Best camera I've owned.
HECK YA I LOVE IT
You get what you paid for
My daughter loved her camera. Very easy to use.
Love it
It takes really cute pictures, but you need to be very careful with distance, lighting, etc. Also, I had a film jam half way through a pack of film, hope it doesn't happen again.
i bought this as a gift for my 15yr old daughter who loves anything and everything vintage and she has been longing for one of these she was really happy and the product is great just as described.
Cute
My daughter wanted an instant camera for her 19th birthday. After reading reviews I decided to go with this Fuji. Really, really cute ! The soft pink color gives it a nostalgic feel. The size of the developed picture is like a credit card. She loved it!
My granddaughter love her new camera. The service was great.
Picture quality is terrible. Waste of money
Pictures are greenish and either very dark or greenish . I saw and used this camera at a wedding and there was no trouble with the quality of the pics. Disappointed . The camera is easy to use, which is great.
my girlfriend simply loved it!
The camera only worked for 1 week and then it no longer worked. I changed the batteries and film after the first roll was used and still nothing. Good thing I purchased a warranty for this camera. Also beware because this camera does not come with a serial number or a model number.
I, like many others according to the reviews, received the Instamax Mini 8 in raspberry that does not have a selfie mirror. When I decided between options, I also chose it because it was a unique color and also for the selfie mirror since that was the added bonus. Disappointed the product I received did not have that option as advertised.That being said, it's a fun, instant camera. Throw in the batteries that were included and a pack of film and fun will ensue. Overall, fun, inexpensive instant camera. Much better deal buying through Amazon than through outlets like Urban Outfitters, in every color.
Fujifilm has brought back the nostalgia of having instant photos at your fingertips. The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera is light-weight and affordable compared to other instant film cameras. Polaroids in general have returned to the market with the pop culture movement for instant photos, however Polaroid cameras and the film are far from affordable. The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera provides all the fun and nostalgia of a Polaroid, but at a fraction of the cost. I have used three sleeves of film and have not experienced any problems with the camera itself. It is ergonomic and because it suggests which setting to use based on lighting, it makes photography fun for the little ones as well! While I tend to protect all photography equipment, this camera does tend to scratch due to the plastic body, but the camera function and mechanisms are unscathed. I searched several sites and did a lot of research before deciding on purchasing from this Amazon seller. The product was shipped quickly and was well protected from the negligence of deliverymen. I would purchase from this seller again, and I recommend the Fujifilm Instax 8 Mini Instant Film Camera to all photography novices and instant film enthusiasts.
Such a beautiful camera, loved the color, loved the photos but i must say that no all of the photos get revealed, some of them stay white idk why.
We loved it .. I used it  for my son birthday party, and it was a blast. We had a photo booth and mini camera was perfect for that and the picture we gave them away..
Absolutely the cutest camera ever! It was a present for my daughter and she absolutely LOVES it. Easy to use and takes great Polaroid style pics.
My daughter loves it
Was a gift and far as I know she loved it.
Great fun and for keepsake photos. Got this and the film for my daughter's bridal shower and bachelorette party. Would recommend
Easy to use, good quality and a lot of fun, brought back a lot of memories from old Polaroid
Great  product !!! It takes good picture and cute looking... Using this to my baby... Taking pictures monthly and posting it in his walls
Came in early. The package is great. The color baby blue is beautiful.
love it! Sure the pictures aren't PERFECT or focused well but if you're a fan of old school pics, this is exactly what you get! Having fun taking pictures while sharing them with family and friends. It's just something about how the picture comes out that gives you a warm feeling. I also recall that many people suggest to angle the camera in a certain way so it can be centered but so far my view lens is pretty accurate every time. Not sure if this is a newer model?
it's super cute! easy to use! totally worth it!
WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS CAMERA!? It is simple A-MA-ZING! I love it! Super easy to use, very cute, light weighted!
This cameras is excellent. It's great for art projects, which is exactly why I purchased it. It'll also make for great lasting memories. Although it's probably easier and faster to snap photos with your phone it still isn't as fun and cool as having small instant photos to carry around. It's definitely an attention grabber, but better yet a conversation starter. I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a camera out of the ordinary and fun. You can also purchase the film relatively cheap on Amazon, which I suggest buying in bulk as it's more economical and you'll run through a roll pretty quick.
I loved the camera. It was a present for my younger sister takes great pictures. Its a cute gift, very thoughtful and creative.
My daughter loves it, but the quality of the photos isn't great
bought for my daughter as a gift....she loved it!!
Bought this for my 12 year old daughter. She adores it! Very simple to use.
This camera is great.  Love being able to get pictures right when I take them.  Kids love this camera.
Loved
Came in less then a week! I'm already very satisfied with my camera! Works great!
This little gadget is great for fun nights with friends thank you.
Although the film is extremely expensive, it was totally worth it! The pictures come out so clear and vibrant!
Good camera to play and take funny pictures. But dont expect great images from it.
I love it!!!! Takes me back in time
I got everything I ordered just when I was supposed to! 2 day shipping worked great and nothing came broken or defected. Love it.
ive had this thing for less than a month, and it shattered into about 10 pieces, after being dropped about six inches off of the ground, i regretibly did not get the spills and drops protection, but I also cant find any repair parts online, the bulb shattered, and many pieces of the lens came apart. waste of 80 dollars.
Awesome
My daughter loved this when she first got it.  Like all things, it's in the closet now among the dust and shadows.  Good thing maybe because the film was so expensive.  Good for parties to take pictures and let the guests take the photos home right away.
This is one of my most favorite purchases that I've made in a LONG time... I just took my first couple of photos and they turned out absolutely amazing and I am in love with this camera! It takes amazing pictures and they are so cute I cannot wait to start collecting more and more photos to use in scrapbooks, home decor, and little photo albums. Super happy! <3
These are so fun. I love it!
Love it!❤
My daughter loves this.
Works perfectly! I love it so much!
Good!
I was very disappointed when I received this item.
Its perfect, its portable and just amazing
It works really well it was a big hit at the party
LOVE IT! Took it to a weddnig and got tons of compliments on it. People were asking about it and where I got it from. Even better I got it a day before I was expecting to. So happy I made this purchase!
Came sooner than expected and it works fantastically.  I love this camera so much.
sooo cute. i decorated mine with puffy molang stickers :)
Takes great photos
Gift for our daughter she loves her camera.
My camera ceased working and pulling film thorough, although in the box it claims there is a one year warranty the company claims my product is outside of claiming its damage. That is absurd, why offer a one year manufacturer warranty under that case?? So unprofessional.
Great gift for a 13 year old girl!  She loves it!  I believe her mom said that she squealed when she opened up her gift.  I am very happy and she is too.
Love my instax camera. It's easy to use and love the photos it takes. Great for parties and scrapbooking.
I loved all of these products
good deal and works well
BE WARNED: If you use this outside you have to cover the flash, and even that only works in overcast conditions. I used in the daytime and covered the flash, set it to the daylight setting, and my photos were just white (meaning way overexposed). :(
I ordered the polaroid camera thinking that it would come as described and it didn't. It was missing the selfie mirror that was supposed to make it worth its price and its limited edition claim. The seller lied about the product that they were selling.
Nice
On time and great thanks
Works great!  We will be using this for a wedding to take a picture of all of the guests for the bride and groom to have instead of a sign in book!  We tried it out first and it worked perfectly!
Not the best, at least not for the money . The film is incredibly expensive so, it's more of a investment in the long run than now.
Love love love! Great way to make a photo album for my child when she gets bigger! Small cute Polaroids ;) worth the money!
Fun camera but not always great prints.  I'm still learning to use it though. Great shipping and got it when they said I would.
It's  perfect.
My best friend used her blue camera with me and it was fun, so I just had to buy a pink one for myself!  It came with the wrist strap and it's easy to use. Takes great photos indoors and outdoors!  The price is worth it because I've seen it in stores for over $100.  And I received this quicker than expected, right before my birthday.  :)  It is perfect in every way. Highly recommend this purchase.
My daughter loves it. It's easy to use and looks good too
It's so cute. Too bad it doesn't come with film
Love my camera ... Easy to use, perfect for capturing any moment worth remembering. Very cute color... Overall a great product
Excellent product!
Nice
Really a cute camera! I use it in my daily life when hang out with my friends.
It came it late which was super upsetting but I love it. It was in great condition and looked lovely
so happy with my purchase! :)
Awesomee!! Love it the camera!!
I am very concerned about the moisture in the box...It wasn't raining or anything it as just there (just kidding it's a awesome camera)
All the pictures come out dark. No instructions on how to change or fix that. Info it comes with doesn't tell you about the features.
MY FAVORITE!
In a world...of digital cameras, sometimes total retro-analog-only one is a nice balance.  I loved the instant cameras growing up. The last one I got some years ago went "away" when no film was available. It only did stickers but they were such fun to add in mail, in art, etc. These seem to be used by a lot of young girls and for weddings but the minute I show these to fellow artists they run out and get one. I adore mine. I justified it by wanting to do an art install.  So okay, I'll get around to it sooner or later.  Meanwhile I'm having fun.
recieved item was broken it was my daughters bday gift and she was so disapppointed..
My daughter loves this machine. Product name is excellent great purchase
I'm happy with it, thx!!
This is probably my favorite investment this year. My boyfriend and I bought this as something fun to do while we traveled to Asheville, NC. Not only did we love taking photos for ourselves, but we also loved seeing the surprise and joy on people's faces when we offered to take an instant photo of them. It was a great way to document our trip and start conversations with locals. Now my boyfriend and I take the camera everywhere. The quality of the photos is amazing for what it is. It just takes a while to figure out the appropriate light settings above the lens. Word of wisdom - DO NOT "shake it like a polaroid" - it is so tempting, I know...
My kid loves this camara
ok
We love this camera! The prints are smaller than the old fashion Polaroid pictures, but they come out very clear. It's easy to operate and is a hit at all our gatherings!
I bought this camera in yellow because yellow is probably the silliest color you could get it in.  It looks like a child's toy camera, the kind that is designed to be chunky so that a child's stupid little hands could grab ahold of it and take a poorly composed photograph of an annoyed cat.  This is my level of skill when it comes to photography so it's pretty much right for me.  The pictures come out pretty well as long as you've got the correct light setting picked out, which is pretty simple to do.  Get this if you're just in it to have fun at parties with a dumb camera, not if you're some serious artist trying to make a statement.
Worked for 10 pics (one film pack) then quit. Don't waste your money.
Cute camera
Absolutely love this camera! I bought it for my lady and it's exactly what she wanted as far as an instant print camera goes (:
I love it! Got here pretty quick too!
just love this little camera comes in handy for those times you just need a picture now so easy to use and perfect for my scrapbooking
excellent
I felt in love with this camera. Is a little big but I like the pictures it takes. They have the vintage look. Very easy to set up and use.
My 12 yr old daughter loves her camera.. Got 2 from family she keeps one in her back pack.. already started an album of pics...
My daughter said this is a fun camera. Who knew that old fashion film like a poloroid would make a comeback
Perfect!!! Very simple to use and extremely cute
My wife has fallen in love with this camera. She takes client pictures and this helps keep it fun and light. The instant gradification factor is the big upside here. The picture are clear and the different boarders add variety to the film packs. On time shipping and great packaging too.
Great camera. Love the size of the pictures and the ability to have them right away.
Bought it for my niece and she loves it!  Nice price not pics.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the film is pricey.  Nevertheless it's perfect for a teenager.
I purchased this camera for my fiancé and she instantly fell in love with it!
Very good my sister loved and works like a charm thank you
Exactly as stated. Fast Delivery!
the quality was very impressive.  i love it.  my bar standards are very high. i hardly ever give a 5 star.  so a 4 star from me means the product is great.
The camera doesnt even work i tried taking a picture of myself with brand new film and the picture is just black and i cant believe i paid 70 dlls for this
I bought this camera and it worked great the first time... But after that, the flash never went off, so unless you were outside on a really bright day, all of the pictures would turn out black. I wasted a ton of expensive film that didn't turn out. It was a bummer.  So I had to return it and get a new one. Hopefully it works better than the first one!
It is great
Obsessed with this camera, great price and so much fun to use
Daughter loves it, takes nice pictures and film is not too expensive.
bought for my teenage daughter.  so far she loves it. i wish the film were cheaper but that is the only con.  works great.
I'm very disappointed when I received this... I bought this camera because of its cute color and the selfie mirror. But I got another one without the mirror which is different from the description and the pictures from the site...
Exactly as expected. Great quality. Would buy again! Wonderful color
Great!! Got it used but can't tell! The box was ripped but the camera looked brand new. I've been using it for 8 months now and it works perfectly! Would highly recommend. All my friends love it too.
Great camera. Good quality pictures. Loved it
I bought this for myself along with a 20 pack of film and a case. Camera takes adorable credit card photos with good but vintage looking quality. Make sure to read all the instrunctions first, oh and it came withing TWO DAYS.
Love it
Packaging wasn't in English but it's all pretty much self explanatory! Everything else was perfect:)Film not included.
Nice
This is an awesome camera.  It's so fun to take out and about - NO ONE prints photos anymore.  Guessing it's becoming more and more popular because I'm seeing the price of film increasing tremendously.  So will probably look for another film option, if there is one.  But definitely a good time!!
In love!
very cute and my 11 year old daughter loves it and so do I
perfection
I used the camera on my wedding to create a Photobook, everyone love it! The size and weight is perfect, you can carry the camera easilyEven when we used the camera during night, the flash and pics quality is good, was a great surprise.The only thing is, the viewfinder its a bit small, so you need to get use to it.
Love it!!
great
really nice case for the money
Love my camera I've had it for months and it's still just as amazing as when I got it.
Love this camera! It was a huge hit at my daughters birthday party
Nice!
I bought this camera almost a year ago, and I have had so much fun with it! I've taken it with me on little vacations and to Disneyland. I really like the size, it fits in most of my bags. It is pretty durable, I've dropped it two or three times, and it still works the same. The color is true to the picture, and it's really easy to clean. There is a bit of a learning curve, so don't expect your first roll to all come out perfect. Film can be pricey, so buy in bulk, maybe the 50 pack? Wouldn't buy the 100 pack, because the film does expire. Don't buy the film from urban outfitters, it's a total rip-off. Everyone who sees is totally smitten with it, as am I. It's nice to have photos to actually hold on to, instead of just a quick snap on your phone that you never look at again.Pros: durable, lightweight, so much fun!Cons: Having to really value your film, like not taking a shot of literally everything, and trying not to give them away (it's hard, people love these things!)
This is one of my favorite things I defiantly recommend this camera mine has held up beautifully. Just make sure you do your research on it before you buy it because some people don't know how expensive the film is and/or don't know how to handle it (which isn't very hard if you watch a tutorial) and end up ruining their film.
The pictures turned out great and the camera is very easy to use.
Replacing the films get expensive
Awesome device and a great gift.
Bueno
LOVE THEM! SO CUTE!
Amazing
My daughter loves it!
Let my kid talk me into ordering this for her. (Apparently Taylor Swift has one, yadda, yadda.)What an absolute waste of money. The photos are so small that I can fit 3 of them across the face of my iPhone 5. Guessing they are 1.5 x 2 inches. Really guys? Any smaller and it should be sold with a magnifying glass.This is definitely one of those "fad-for-a-day" items. It has already been relegated to the back 40 of her bedroom and she hasn't even gone through the second pack of film. The film is so crazy expensive that she is afraid to take a crummy photo.
takes great pictures
really love it.
Such a fun toy for my grown up life.
Rather bulky, pictures are small (about 3x5") but the picture quality is very good.
Camera arrived sooner than expected! Camera is not small, but not too big. It is built well, durable and good quality. It takes me back to my childhood! The kids were surprised when the film popped up and they started to see the picture appear.  This is a camera will capture a lot of fun memories! I only wish the film was cheaper!
Good
i bought this as a gift and i have one. i love having it around and using it for parties or family get togethers. i buy the film in bulk on amazon.
Bought a couple of these for a NYE party and they were a huge hit! So much more phone than pics on your phone. They worked great, took decent pictures and withstood the abuse of multiple drops over the course of the night
Good
is perfect.
Bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it! Works great! I would recommend buying a lot of film with it. We mostly use it to capture special occasions and such. I would recommend this to people of all ages because it is easy to use.
so cute love it
Great product
I was impressed. Loved it
Easy to use and works great
Love it. It's timeless. I want 23 more! haha!
Really cute!!! It would make a great Birthday gift for your girlfriend or daughter.
Birthday gift for daughter....very happy with this gift.
5 months old and it is already broken.
The best deal ever.
Absolutely love it!
I LOVE IT! Totally worth it! Every time I take pictures with it, people fall in love with it! Love how fast and easy it is!!
My granddaughter loved the camera and the accessory kit
This is an amazing little camera that is an homage to Polaroids of the past.  It is extremely easy to use and produces very nice images.  We recently had a baby so this is perfect for taking little photos and putting them on the wall, corkboard, fridge, wallets, etc.  The film is easy to load and the flash is quite efficient.  If you want to have something for instant cameras feel free to get this!  Everyone that sees us using it always compliments on how wonderful it is.
Love it!  But the directions are in Chinese!!
Bought for my wife, she likes it but is use is not often given the ease and accessibility of a smart phone.
Love this little camera! It's easy to use, the picture quality is surprisingly good, and it's so much fun to play with!!
My daughter saved her money for this and was very happy with it!
I love it. It was just what I wanted. it fit all my requests and really easy to use.
sweet memory in Disney
A birthday gift for my daughter and she loves it !
Pictures dark and spotty, even though film isn't expired. I have horror hound to go to Tomorrow and bought this with all my birthday money :( I'm really sad about it. Other people's pictures turn out great. I'm hoping to get a replacement.
Daughter loves taking photos and has enjoyed the camera so far...no issues, easy to use.
I loved the concept and thought about getting one of these for a year before I did it. I'm an avid journaler and wanted the pictures to add to them.  Sadly, I'm not impressed.  I've gone through my first box of film and got only 2 useable pictures for my journals.  In my opinion, the photos are not very clear, and every one comes out too dark no matter the setting.  No happy, I feel I wasted the money :(
Very fast shipment and very satisfied... This was a gift for someone and she absolutely loved it!!! Thank you :)
I like it. It look pretty good.
Great instant film camera. Worked great for my reception and much less expensive than a photo booth.
First off, I didn't even know they still made Polaroid film cameras. Until I saw my sister-in-law with the pink one and that prompted me to do a little research. I got the yellow Instax Mini 8 as a Christmas gift last year and I absolutely love it! Do I think it should replace digital photos? No, but it's a fun and cute way to relive days gone by, especially if you're someone who likes showing off the kind of pictures you can take and you don't need to snap 10 photos in a burst just to get one that looks good.Now that being said, this is why I don't understand the people buying this camera as a gift for their 6 year olds and then complain over the price of the film. Of course it's going to be pricey when being used by someone who will go through an entire pack of film in roughly 90 seconds.Just because the technology is considered a relic by current standards doesn't mean it's best suited for the very young.Pros:Small camera and therefore very suitable for taking it on trips and such.Has just enough weight to it to imply it's well-made but not too heavy.Batteries last a super long time...even the offbrand ones they send with the camera.Despite complaints that pictures come out dark, I will try to elaborate: the background of indoor shots are indeed dark, but the focal point is bright and in focus. At least for me.Cons:Honestly? Curbing the desire to take lots and lots of shots with it.And also, do yourself a favor and buy the accessory bundle that's sold right here on Amazon. For roughly $45, you get a case, mini photo album, selfie mirror and a few other little bits that make it a great deal.
This order was amazing! I use it with all my friends and they all love to watch the picture come out of the top and wait to see how the picture came out. And best of all they get to keep it! The product was perfect and came in wonderful condition.
The pictures are incredibly beautiful!
It's amazing, going to buy 2 more, hopefully a good price range like this blue one I bought.
So adorable and it works great.
Cool
Works great! Even better than what I had expected. The picture quality is good, can be a little less indoors, but still overall can't complain. The order arrived quick and I didn't have any problems.
Fantastic little instant picture camera. Receive many compliments on camera and pictures. Not light, has some weight to it meaning to me it's good quality. Works great. Bought color Pink and it's very feminine. Adult usage but child could definitely use also. Easy to use. Perfect purchase and much smaller than my old Poloroid which it's impossible to find film for. I purchased an additional box of film and the Accessory kit for this camera which comes with a very nice case in matching color of Pink. I take this camera everywhere now.
Pictures are good quality and a lot of fun. Film is reasonably priced.
Great camera. Reminds me of Polaroid days. Daughter loves it. Colors are not very bright on film but it works. Just a bit on the dark side. Great way for taking memory shots and great for those who scrapbook.
Cute little camera. Takes photos that are the quality you'd expect from a instant print, slightly vintage feel is nice.Love the yellow color and the wrist strap!
Loved it my 12 yr old bbygirl loves it got home when expected .... great purchased!!
I'm 17 and I love it. Good gift.
very happy
Daughter loved it
Perfect!!!
Thank you!! Love it!!
Love it!
This camera is phenomenal. We were looking for the easiest and most affordable way to have a photo booth for my daughter's Sweet 16th birthday party. This is it. The camera is a pretty color and wonderfully designed. It is fantastic to be able to get high quality photos instantaneously.
excellent and fun to use.  Works in perfect condition.
I love my Polaroid at first I was afraid of getting one but it's worth it I have so much photos that I love you should order from this seller
about 30% photos come out blank; after researching online this appears to be a defective camera, and is a common defect...  make sure to check yours out while it is in the return/warranty period
Camera shoots out failed images half the time
Cool and excellent purchase. Great seller!
This camera is amazing!!! Definitely helps create memorable events!!!
so in love with this <3
Love it!!!  So excited to use it for my new DIY project
I've wanted one of these for years, and now I finally have one and I'm in love! This is better than my digi cam! Reminds of the good ol' days! I love how small the film is. This will be perfect for my wedding!
I love it! Easy to use..
My 9 year old LOVES this camera!  She has so much fun with it and it's fun with sleep overs when they can have their pictures right away.
Love it!
its great & the photos come out fabulous
Bought this for my 15 year old daughter. She is having fun using it. The film is pretty pricey, but she doesn't use it often. For a fun little camera with fun photos, very worth the price.
Nice camera for instant gratification. Wouldn't have been my choice for size of pics, but 12 yr old daughter wanted it and chipped in. Likes it very much. Looks nice.
Love the camera!!!
Daughter  loves it
I love this camera!!! the packaging was okay it came with its original box however I was expecting some film with it so I had to buy it separate but it is a good quality camera! :)
Cutest camera!  My 8 year old loves using this camera to document the fun she has with her friends.  I've borrowed it to use the film to help me label some toy boxes around the house.  Worth every penny!
my daughter loved it photos nice
Got it for my lady, and she loved it and the color. It is so lovely that someone finally started making instant film again, the impossible film project has been getting pricey, and you can actually find film for them in most camera shops for the instax
I got mines today and I when I opened it up I got the camera working and the moment I took a picture I couldn't stop, I'm in love !
When I first took a pic inside and it was on the indoor the picture came out too bright
Light weight, great photos, very vintage. It's perfect and highly recommended.
We used it for my daughter's wedding shower photo booth, it was tons of fun and the pictures turned out super cute.  It is a very modern version of the old-fashioned​ polaroid cameras!!!
Awesome camera :) easy to use and super cute
Love it !
I like t but the film is way too expensive I should have thought about it before I bought it
It is such a beauty, I love it. I'll be taking it to France in July.
Arrived on time. Great gift idea.
I love this camera its so cool and its cheaper on amazon than any other stores
Bought this as a 13 y/o girls' gift - she cried she loved it so much! Awesome. They were so excited to watch it develop!
The camera is awesome very crafty
ITS A VERY nice PRODUCT... IT CAME AS I SPECTED… I RECOMMENDED… QUALITY 95%... WE ARE USING IT WITH NO TROUBLE AT ALL 100% OK…
wonderful
Love Love Love it.. my daughter is sooo happy with her new camera
awesome very cute just dont take pics in the winter during the day
I love it so much!
Teen dream.  Great birthday gift and a grateful teen happy to photograph her friends.  Fast and secure shipment with good prices.
luv it
great gift for a teenage girl. Love the colors
Great camera
Perfect teen gift!
Use it all the time. Works perfectly.
The camera took blurry pictures and the center marker on the lens is off, so all pictures were off center.  I returned it.
It is the best buy ever! The pictures are so pretty with a natural filter!!
This was a Christmas present for our 4 year old granddaughter.  She opened it Christmas Eve and spent the rest of the evening taking pictures of EVERYTHING.  Good thing we purchased extra film.
This Camera is awesome. Im a guy and was a bit comprehensive on buying this but let me tell you the camera is attractive and takes great instant pictures
kids loved it
This camera is so easy and fun to use. I love it. The film is a little pricy but I think its worth the nostalgia
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY INSTAX! I use it for everything and it is the best camera and buy I've ever made. I would definitely recommend. It also has the cheapest instant film and is genuinely a great camera! Super fun. It is bulky, but it's so cute! WOULD BUY IN ALL COLORS IF I COULD.
this camera makes my daughter's heart go pitter pat.
Exactly as advertised!
Everything was fine.
So cute! love this camera
Came in the original box unopened and sealed Inside another box and some bubble wrap to protect the product. Loved it! :D
exactly what I expected no issues with delivery
Excellent camera , I love it !
I'm in love with my camera!
The battery door case thing doesn't even stay on all the way - it's not like it falls off but there's a gap between it and the camera. I'm hoping it doesn't break completely later on.This camera takes beautiful, vintage-esque photos. Just make sure you don't load the film in the wrong way or it will get jammed. I did this and had to pry it out with a knife.If you're deciding between getting this camera or a polaroid, go with this camera. The film is so much cheaper.
I'm inlove with this camera!
great camera, fun - pictures aren't always clear and film gets pricey
I absolutely love it. Came in on time and in perfect condition used it for my birthday and at a party and it's perfect no complaints at all.
Got it quickLove itOrder film online in packs of 50it's worth it and cheaper than at storeExperience:it's best for close upsAlways check your flash settings to make the best of exposuresIn room's were there is no natural light group pics with flash may cause pics to come out darkmake sure there is nothing close to lense because it causes darkening of exposureBeautiful colors when pictures are taken in the natural sunlight.
Bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it. Everytime we go somewhere new she takes a mini picture. The quality is great given the size.
I love this camera! I just thought that some film would come with it, just a heads up for anyone that buys it, buy film too!
I love this camera so much! It got here very fast and it is described just how it is. Definetly would recommend.
My daughter loves it and enjoys taking pictures!
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! So much fun to use. Can't get enough.
Kids loved it.
super
Film for it is expensive, and the pictures are not that good.
Much bigger than I expected but takes great pictures and I love it!
Very good products my girl love it  and my wife ones that toy
My girls asked me to get this camera for a birthday party.  And I'm really glad they did.  It's great for instant photo booth pictures at a party.  I grew up with Polaroid instant pictures, and this is the same concept, only smaller.  The kids loved having their own shots to take home immediately, of course.  It CAN get kind of pricey for film, so shop around and buy in bulk if necessary.  Camera works fairly decent.  All of my pictures are legible and the ones I have posted on my bulletin board haven't faded as of yet.
I love my new Fuji instax camera. It's so easy to use and I absolutely love the color. It takes really cute pictures.
LOVE LOVE LOVE, no complaints. i watched many youtube videos and read many reviews before i bought this and i have been using for about a month, gone through tons of film and i have zero compliants
Taking advantage of some Christmas Amazon gift card gifts, I decided to splurge on this. It was a great decision. The camera looks adorable even when it is not in use, and the pictures are of a nice quality. The camera arrived in great, careful packaging, and it is true to picture. The one drawback is the expense for film, but if you are wise with the pictures you take, and if you have any Amazon gift cards at all, there are plenty of good deals. It is a very fun product, to hear the snap and the film coming out, and to see your picture actually have to take time and develop is very exciting, compared to the quick iPhone pictures that are posted all over social media. I would recommend to anyone!
Great
It came in very good condictions :)
the pictures came out perfect ! I love this camera and it's so easy to use
amazing and awesome fun for kids
AMAZING!!! Although it wish it wasn't so expensive, this was definitely my best investment.
This is perfect. I will be used at a wedding for selfies. Thank You.
This camera is so cute! I love it and the vintage feel to the pictures. Shipping was quick and it got to me all in one piece. I'm 100% glad I got this.
The camera is a bit big and a little annoying to carry around so I wounldnt recommend it for traveling. It is however super fun to use with friends at get togethers and parties!
Couldn't be more happier about this camera!
We bought this for our Sons first birthday, we wanted to have a photo booth type thing. It worked great, film is a bit expensive but was loads of fun! We got to keep a lot of pictures for our birthday album and guest got to take ones home to remember the birthday bash!
This is a great product the only reason I took away a star is because the directions to put film in aren't in English but overall I love this camera!!! The pictures came out clear!
i love my polaroid. works fine. Just the instructions are a bit unclear, but it does what its supposed to do!
Great Deal, thank you!
Great camera and came VERY quickly, i love it!!
Super pleased with the product and prompt delivery! I will definitely be a repeat customer!
I got it for my niece's Bdays, she love it
Absolutely love this camera I got the yellow one and I love the color and how great it works. It's relatively simple to use I'm still getting used to it and trying to figure out somethings still but it's very simple and I love the instant pictures it's super fun to take pictures with it and see them come out instantly. The camera works great and easy enough for anyone to use I highly recommend it.
I've had it for two months and when I take pictures the poloroid comes out blank really disappointed
A
Great little "polaroid" camera. Pictures come out better than we expected.  My daughter loves this little thing....but beware of the film. Mighty pricey.
I purchased this item for a trip and so long as you know its limitations, it's a lot of fun. Don't buy it expecting HD quality images as it is a true Polaroid camera and will print out photos just like the old ones did. It's really best for closeup images, but if you want to take scenery or distance shots, it can work. I found I had to second-guess the light detection for far away shots, but it's quite accurate for anything close up. It's more about the instant satisfaction of the moment and having a physical photo to walk away with.
I really love this produce !! Good price and fast shipping!
Easy to use, great pictures.  I'm using this for my wedding instead of a guest sign in book.  I've practiced with it to see how the pics look and they are perfect.  Lightweight and seems durable.  So excited and happy with the purchase, only downside the film is expensive, but the more you buy the better the discount:)
Camera came in on time and included batteries and a strap. Have not used it yet but by appearance it is everything I expected it to be.
Brightened up my 13 yr old daughter’s life for sure! She loves this camera and the ability to give the pics to her family, friends, and putting the pictures EVERYWHERE! Me being a teenager of the 80's I absolutely loved my Polaroid camera so it is a bit nostalgic for me too! :)
Oh dear, this little camera is going to make me spend so much money on film. I must say, I was pretty hesitant on buying this camera, especially in white. But it has proven me wrong. It is not only cute in white, but the camera itself is amazing. It takes wonderful photos and flashes with every shot (not to worry, this only makes the pictures come out better). I haven't used it outside yet because I heard the temperature may effect the photo and it is freezing where I am right now, but even inside it takes great photos. So worth it!
great price
Hello, I am writing late but maybe my camera does not work, because they do not print photos, please return me my money.
Adorable little camera.  So fun.  Be sure to read the instructions and you'll get great results!
This camera is well worth the price. I've been wanting to buy an instant camera for a while, but was unsure on which product to buy. I was researching various vintage Polaroid cameras, when I came upon Fujifilm instant cameras. I liked the idea of having a modern-made camera, but with a vintage feel. Getting an instant camera from Fujifilm would mean I would have a working camera that printed pictures once I took them, but still have that "old-memory" quality to them. As I looked more into the various models, I discovered the Instax Mini 8. I like the simple design and the low-maintenance aspect to it. All you really needed was 2 AA batteries, a pack of film, and (as with all tech products) proper care. [Note: I bought a CAIUL case/bag for my camera that matches its color, as can be seen in my pictures]At first, I was going to buy the simple white color, but I saw the limited-edition Raspberry and Grape ones. I leaned towards buying the Raspberry-colored model because I thought it was more eye-catching. I've taken a few pictures with it and they've all came out beautiful! I think the flash adds to the vintage-quality of the developed photos, because the ones I took looked rather 90s, but clearer. The small selfie-mirror in the front is very helpful because it shows you exactly what you'll be taking a picture of.I have already gotten some compliments on my camera. My best friend, who owns a couple of Polaroid cameras loves the quality of my Instax Mini 8 pictures. She says her Polaroid pictures are nice, but aren't as high quality. So, if you have reservations about buying these instead of the vintage Polaroid cameras, don't. This camera will guarantee you beautiful vintage pictures, and is less than the price of refurbished/working Polaroids. Plus this color is so beautiful and will only be available for a limited amount of time.
I ordered this for my girlfriend since she always wanted a instant film camera. She loved it! She enjoyed taking photos of her events and it was a conversation starter.
I like the color and size. Its not like the old instant camera it actually takes decent pics and so its fun for parties or scrap-booking.
The pics are very small, but works great
My daughter loves it.  I think it's hilarious that young people who have grown up with digital cameras think that this type of camera is so unique!
love it!
Best buy in recent several months. The picture quality is much better than expectation. It is not just a fun camera. It can keep memories in a fantastic way that digital camera cannot. Strongly recommend that you should buy one. The camera itself is not expensive anyway. Maybe films are pricey a little bit.
Was delivered on time works great and no problems happened
awesome!
very nice thnx..........
Film was as expected
Purchased this camera for my teenage daughter and she absolutely loves it! Will recommend to anyone in the market for one of these.Pros- works great, easy to use and pictures look good.Con's - Film can be a bit pricey.
Bought as a gift for my niece - she loves it but the cost of the film is keeping her artistic self from taking off.  I wish they could come up with more reasonably priced film.
I've given this to two people, and they both absolutely love it.
Love it. Thank you. 
It ok
Absolutely perfect camera! If only the film the cheaper then i'd definitely use it more
Love my camera
this camera is amazing my daughter loves it and uses it all the time..highly recommended
Very good quality
I was extremely disappointed in this camera.  All of my shots were either overexposed or underexposed - one didn't come out at all.  It had an auto feature for light exposure, but I was not able to adjust it.
You don't have to be a camera expert to be able to work this film camera and that's why I think I love it so much! It's nice to have something so simple and easy to work. I myself am pretty familiar with varieties of cameras but I love how simple this one is. The camera itself is pretty compact in size, lightweight and comes with a little strap for your wrist. I really wanted either the Grape of Raspberry color but both were backordered on a different site (couldn't find them available on Amazon yet) and the Black was either sold out, on backorder, or way more expensive compared to the rest of the colors so I settled for the Pink and I couldn't be more happier. The film is also great quality at a great value as well. Compared to the new production of Polaroid film, this is the more affordable route. 8 Polaroid exposures/$30 vs. 60 Fugifilm Instax Mini 8 exposures/$48. I'm a very impatient person and the shipping on this item was perfect with Amazon Prime! Ordered on a Friday night, delievered on my doorstep Sunday morning! Absolutely no complaints!
Very satisfied. I bought the Instax Mini 7S at first and hated it. It was too big, faded white color and bad picture quality. The Mini 8 was a huge step up. Smaller size that's easier to carry around, cute colors and better film quality. Luv it!
Bought this and suprise my girlfriend and she loved it !!!! A+++ TO SELLER.
xmas present but its a cool little camera to have, its like having the old poloroid
THIS CAMERA IS MY LIFE! ughhhh I love it so much!
I SUPER LOVE THIS! High quality photos! Using for visitor coming to meet our newborn baby for the first time. Highly highly recommend this! I just wish film was cheaper... But it's worth it! Love how the photos turn out and the size of them!
Did not work. Went thru 2 packs of film trying to adjust camera and fix. Finally returned product. Waiting on replacement.
took longer than i wanted,butwas happy with the product
GREAT!
Loved this camera. And came on time. Strongly recommend so fun
The camera came in perfect condition and nothing is wrong with it, even though flash goes off even in the daylight, but that's not a big deal. It's exactly what I was hoping for, and I would recommend to anyone wanting a cute (somewhat) cheaper polaroid camera since the older models are a bit pricey.
My teenage daughter loves this!
I gave both  granddaughters this camera.  They asked for it as a gift and they both like it and use it, so I'm  happy.
Great product
Favorite thing I've bought! Amazing picture quality and love the fujifilm border theme film packs
very good quality, got it before the expected time, and my girlfriend loves it.
Very cute and not too heavy to carry
greatt!!
Love it (:
This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. Loves having her own camera to take pictures. She is very Happy with this camera.
I like that the photos are instant. The image takes longer to appear than I would have thought, which is roughly a minute. Make sure you're aware of the picture setting. I took some pictures outside during a sunny afternoon and the photos didn't turn out (they were really white, no image appearing). It wasn't until I changed the setting on the camera to sunny that the pictures came out, which still had less definition than I like. The photos tend to be quite white. It probably works better inside than outside.
Just the perfect gift for my daughter and it also arrived in a short time.
Works and looks as expected. I bought mine at $75 (including shipping) and I'm happy with the result. All the functions work and the pictures come out lovely every time! I'm glad to start using this for scrapbooking soon and it's just nice to have your pictures be printed out and be tangible.It's almost as if the memories captured within the photos are tangible themselves.
Do not buy from this seller the camera did not work!
Daughter loves this! Arrived as expected.
Items received and a good contition.Thanks.
Love this camera! The only drawback is the price of the film- and that there is usually one dud in each film package.
It costed us less, and my daughter is very happy!
Great little camera. Slower to develop than old Polaroids and color isn't perfect, but a fun accessory.
Love it, works great
Perfect! Thank you for a good buy!
Bought it for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves the thing. Only problem is finding the film in stores every now and then. Maybe that's just us, but we've pretty much had to order all the film. Great camera!
super!!!!!!!!!!
I love it! Absolutely everything I thought it would be! It's perfect size takes the most beautiful pics, it so vintage nd has more meaning to the pictures it takes! Forsure everything I wanted!
Great item & super fast delivery ,!
i love it! :)
film for our new camera and it works like it was supposed to
My camera is a hit or miss. I've taken many photos that either don't develop at all, or they partially develop.. It's a shame! This is my second Fujifilm Instax camera, and this one is so bad compared to the other I had.
7 year old Granddaughter loves this camera. Her an her friends have made a lot of memories.
love IT
I would have loved this a lot more, if my photos actually printed when I snapped shots. I was so upset when I would take photographs and the film would come up blank, but by the time I realized I could exchange or return it the 30-day return policy had been up.
I love this camera! Got it for Christmas. It's so fun and the best Polaroid camera I've ever has. Love the color, and the style it's so hipster!
Great product and prompt delivery.
Everyone that has bought this camera had some free film sadly mine didn't come with any but it's perfect and I love it !
This polaroid has changed my life. Gone is digital pictures and in comes the old fashioned film cameras! I have always longed to own an instant camera and here is a great deal for cheap! I did my research on which would be the best and Fujifilm beats all other odds. It came very quickly in the mail and was well packaged, ensuring that the camera would not be jostled around during shipping period.The camera itself is very cute, comes with a strap and everything! There are multiple light settings you can adjust it to and it even has an automatic sensor to guide you towards which setting is the best in which lighting. There are also so many different types of things you can do with it and is portable. The film is also fairly inexpensive, especially if you buy in bulk and there are so many types to choose from. Overall, this is a wonderful product and can be used in your daily life to preserve and keep those precious memories of events, friends, and family!
Just got my raspberry fujifilm instax mini 8 camera!! I love love love it! Shipping was fast and everything was worth it! Thank you so much!!!
This was a gift for my 8 year old! Love it! Fabulous present!!!
LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera! Came packaged very nicely and works beautifully. Its my baby.
My daughter loves this and so do her friemds
Cute, but photos arent very good quality. Does the job!
Fun camera! Bought for little sister for Christmas but I would consider buying for myself. She had so much fun with it and the pictures turned out pretty cool.
Product is great
I absolutely love this little Polaroid like camera!! It's not made by Polaroid but it looks like it. The pictures are mini and are perfect for scrap booking and just having the actual picture in your hand instantly. The camera has different settings which is awesome and it automatically sets depending on light. You can switch the settings if you wish to make the picture brighter or darker. It is fun to play with the settings and see what type of pictures come out. The camera is awesome and for a good price but the film is quite expensive. But after you learn to take good pictures then the price of the film isn't that bad, you may waste a lot of film in the beginning practicing with the instant pictures.
My daughter loves this.  She got it from her folks at Christmas.  I wish it was easier to buy the film, but at least there is Amazon where it is easy to order.
It's a great camera we like it very much!
Super fast delivery - in original box, new unused camera, batteries and a wristband in the box. I love it!
I ordered a black camera and received a pink one...Not sure where the confusion on that order happened. The pictures come out a little off for some reason. I know it's not my flim so I'm not sure what the problem may be. Overall, it's a good product.
Does not come with film so I was extremely upset !!!! The camera was a bit loose at the tip of lens like it kept shaking.. I was also upset that the lens was really loose
Great device! Works awesome! It's nice to have a lil camera that give you your pictures right at the moment you took them.
What a fun product!  Considering that this is as close to Polaroid as we can get, I highly recommend the Instax.  It's great for parties or something not so conventional.  Easy to use, the option of a warranty is fantastic as well.
Fun
Love it. Is like have your memory with you forever. I won't worry about losing my phone or forgetting my passwords. And I loose those picture. Now I take a picture  and save them and in 10 years I can always look back at them.
I bought this camera for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it! The product is exactly as pictured and very easy to use. My daughter was asking for a Polaroid but she didn't like how bulky my old school full size Polaroid camera was so I was so excited when I ran across this on Amazon. My daughter loves the size of the pictures and has so much fun with her friends snapping pictures on this camera. It was the perfect gift for a teen. I would highly recommend this product.
Good
Everything OK
Got it earlier then expected, love the camera!
Cutest camera ever made easy to use, pictures come out in high quality the only bad thing to me is the film size it's only 10 pictures which I waste like in a day lol bit overall it's an amazing camera and it's a must have
My little girl is so happy with her present.
The camera works great and the pictures were really good but after I took about 3 pictures when I take another it's turns out blank can anyone help?
I like very much nice pictures,good memories
I just got my camera yesterday and I love it. The camera is cute and easy to carry. The pictures come out clear and cute. The only downside is that it doesn't come with any film, so I would recommend ordering some.
first-class
Awesome camera! Cute lil pics!
LOVE this camera but the alignment of the photos are off
Perfect!
Tiny pictures.
I love this camera!! It came in the mail a lot sooner than i expected! My film hasnt came in the mail yet so i can't try it out until then, but i am very satisfied with my purchase! I had one of these as a kid so i feel like its a necessity to have one now that i am older! Thank you so much~! :)
This camera is great! Pretty self explanatory and our 8 year old took pics! Havent found any downfalls and the pictures turned out beautifully! Some came out with that old polaroid look to them but that made it all the more sweet! Speedy delivery, product is as advertised, and easy to use. Would consider it as a gift fot a loved one/friend. I would give this more stars if I could. Far exceeded my expectations!
La la la la love it!!!
My kids loved the camera
These are the best! so cute and fun :)
Fast shipping just as described
This cute camera came in really fast in perfect condition. Pretty straight forward on how to use it and fun to capture memories to be cherished forever, right there on the spot. It's a great gift too (thanks mom, lol). I use mine to create college memories. :)
My teenager  enjoyed  it very well
Granddaughter loves the camera.  Just what she wanted.
Perfect little gift. Love the color.
This polaroid camera isn't bulky as it looks in the picture which is perfect for me since I travel a lot, I can easily put it in my bag and go. I can not stop taking pictures. In this era, we all have camera phones and those pictures just stay their without being developed, so I was excited to capture the moment and have a photo in my hands within 3 seconds and put them in a photo album. You do have to play around with the settings though…. If you're not in a brightly lit area, depending on the setting it will come out black…. or if you're in a place that is too bright, everything will be way to contrasted. So have fun with it, see what works and what doesn't. All in all I love this camera.
We like it, but the pics are tiny.
It's perfect!
better than i expected
Grest camera
Greeeeaaaaaat
Awsome equipment
Perfect! Works great!!
Love it!!
Love it! Got my item in two days really fast shipping! I got the yellow one and its more of a pastel yellow. Everything works great and i get a lot of complements on it.
So excited, its small and fun to use.
fantastic product. highly reccommended
Comes in cute colors. Although the film is a bit pricey, this camera does the job. No problems yet. In love with my fujifilm mini.
So much fun!  Works great! The film is smaller than the old fashioned ones.
Great camera!
Perfect!
Love my camera
I can not express how much I love this camera. It is perfect for anything and everything, I love capturing memories with it, can't find a flaw. Film isn't cheap, but it's so worth it.
Adorable..love it!
MY DAUGHTER LOVED HER CAMERA FOE HER BIRTHDAY N PRICE WAS NOT TOO BAD.
perfect for me
All I have to say is YOU are crazy if YOU don't purchase this AMAZING ITEAM!
My daughter loves this retro camera. She has an $1800.00 cannon and uses the fuji more. Go figure. I even have to pay for film.
I love this camera! Fast shipping got it the next day. Ill definitely buy another one soon.
Works really good and it's super cute.
This product came looking like it is second hand ...... Quite dirty
My daughter likes this.
Amazing. Absolutely  in love
I love this camera so much. It was delivered in less than a week. It takes amazing pictures. I recommend getting a package deal of the camera and film. It will save you money and you will have film the same day the camera comes in. Mine came with the batteries which is amazing. The manual said the batteries should last for 100 pictures. There are a lot of accessories you can get to go with this little camera. It is honestly amazing. I highly recommend getting it. Takes amazing pictures.
Absolutely love it!
It cool camera
Who wouldn't love this? I was going to order this from Urban's, but it's always a good idea to check Amazon. I saved over $50. Such a great product that's easy to use.
Soooooo cute and fun. Fairly well made. I wasn't sure if it was going to be some cheapo plastic thing but its pretty sturdy. Easy to use. Obviously the film is a bit pricey but I think its worth it for special occasions. Pictures are clear and develop well. No issues here.
The picture quality is not that great however nice toy for the kids who never used to print pictures
Great camera! I was a little nervous that the camera was not going to last very long but i've had it for over a year and i use it all the time. I have never had one problem with it and the color is so cute. I've brought it to Hawaii with me and got great shots of scenery, myself, people and nature. I definitely recommend this product to people who like the old fashion way of doing things. Great camera, great price, shipped fast. The only complaint I would make is that the film is not as cheap as i would like to be so buy it in bulk.
This was a gift for my 22 year old daughter, who fell in love with it. She takes great pictures and makes the pictures into collages! People comment on it when ever they see it as it's very, very cute!
amazing!! came in super quick & takes amazing photos!!
I love my new polaroid!
My daughter loves her new camera. It really reminds me of my old Polaroid!
Love it. Such a cute color! So much fun taking pictures! But warning, film is pretty expensive
Love this throw back to the instant camera - business card size pictures.  Bought for my kids (14 & 9) and they love them - they are careful not to take frivolous pictures as each picture is about $1 based on film pricing on Amazon - which I've found to be the cheapest - even better than the big box store.  Camera is a little bulky so ages 8 and up is my recommendation
I have always wanted a fujifilm so I asked for one for Christmas. So far there has been no problems and I like it a lot. It is amazing
Quality of the pictures is terrible!  Not worth the money.  It's been returned!
Bought the camera for my 12 year old daughter, she loves it and it works great.
Loved it!!!!
granddaughter loves it
I love it
Arrived quickly. Just what she wanted.
Good
Bought 2 of these for our grandkids....they love them!  The only downside is that the film is expensive & the kids use it very, very quickly!  Very durable.
My daughter loves her new camera. It takes good pictures
Junk
Nice cam and so fast delivery
My 13-year-old's new favorite toy.  If only the film wasn't so expensive.
Great item and would recommend to anyone.Love Amazon Prime and the fast shipping on everything.
Good
Bought this for my daughters 10th birthday.  She loved it pictures come out nice. I would definitely recommend.
Takes nice pictures thank youand fast delivery through Amazon
Fun product! Wish it came with film- it feels a little overpriced for what it is. But still a great buy imo!
bought this for my gf, she loved it.
Great purchase. The process was very smooth, quick delivery!
Awesome gift for my sister and she loved it!!! Uses it more than Instagram
Wonderful camera, my grand daughter is having fum
Very cute, I thought it would be bigger though.
Our Daugher loved it, and the shipper did a great job!
I love this camera!!! It's cute, fun and super easy to use. I had heard that there was a learning curve so that your pictures don't come out white - but I used my dog as a model and everything came out as expected. Such fun - I highly recommend to everyone!
My daughter is still having a blast with this - reminds of back in the day polaroid cameras.  (big black things).  Really happy with it.
My 13 year old granddaughter loves this camera
exactly what my daughter wanted!
Bought for my daughter as a Christmas gift and she loved it, the pictures are small but extremely cute!
great camera, love the small selfie mirror built in, although the color was not at all vibrant as shown in the picture
My daughter loves it
So far so good I got it on time
Its is so cute n it works well
got it for my friend, she LOVES it! cute little pix
Very pleased
Easy to use
the pink it came in is a little lighter than pictured above. it is small and cute as expected, easy to carry and easy to use. good purchase.
The camera is exactly what I was expecting.
Never record this, and never got a response email stating it was out of stock!! Once again, very disappointed!!
My daughter loves this product would by agai
Very cool camera !
My 8 year old daughter ADORES this camera! Super easy to use. I want one myself!
Daughter loves this camera.
Broke after 2 weeks
So far so good
Absolutely love it! Works as described and looks as depicted! :) Pictures are the cutest AND it has different settings, but sometimes if it's too bright or too dark, the pictures won't come out. Either way, I love it.
Awesome my daughter loves it! It doesn't take pictures like a digital camera the film develops just like an old model polaroid would though. Be better if it at least had an lcd screen. But my daughter is happy with it either way.
I love it. Fast shipping. The camera is cute and light weight me and my four year old son are loving it!
This was a gift for my daughter, who really wanted a Polaroid (i blame Taylor Swift).  The price seemed a bit high for a genuine Polaroid, for a gift for a teenager, who has a phone camera for most of her needs.  But this little camera got some great reviews and was more financially accpetable for us.  And while some people might not like the little photos, she thinks they are darling.
I take this camera everywhere I go. I love it
Its amazinggg
It is very cool!
Thank you
A gift for my teenager daughter...she loves it...novelty of it very retro and cool.
Very cute & easy to carry. The only problem was trying to adjust the lighting on the camera. If it's not done right the picture can come out too dark or light, & a lot of film will be wasted.
Bought it for my girlfriend. She LOVES it. Only thing is - the camera WILL let you take a picture while the shutter is closed - I learned that the hard way.
So much fun! Love it!
I am so happy with this Camera. The color is bright and cute and everywhere I go, people always ask me about my camera. It is so much fun to take pictures and have them printed instantly for everyone to see. The pictures are small, about wallet size, but the novelty and fun factor makes up for the small size of the pictures. The film  can be pricy so try to use it in moderation. I totally recommend this camera, you won't be disappointed with it!
fun camera to use. bring it to parties!
Item as described, super fast shipping, great price...100% recommended
It was exactly what we expected very pleased
LOVE IT
My 11 yr old daughter and her friends are having a blast with this camera.  They think the instant developing is the coolest, and the different borders that you can buy on the mini film is fun!
used it for our wedding. so easy! great photos
Gift for my sister when she was getting married and took pictures at the wedding and it was wonderful to give her an album immediately!
Exactly as described.
Bought this for my daughter who is very artistic and 9 years old. She had watched some youtube videos and wanted to try this. She loves it. She has taken tons of pictures. The only issue is that it Is expensive now that I'm used to having digital, but it is fun for her.  Easy to load the film.
It's cute, easy to use and I use it all the time!
Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter.  Nice little camera for a pre-teen who loves taking pictures with her friends.
Great
Camera was great, but haven't taken pictures yet can't get film.  Hope the pictures are good.
It eureka fine but pictures are really small.
This is so fun.  So cute. Such a nostalgic throw back to my youth.  And it's super fun to take a picture of a millennial kid, say, a 22 year old bartender - and then actually hand them a physical picture, right there on the spot and watch their mind get blown IRL.  It's kind of hilarious. Suddenly, this old lady is the fun one taking live selfies in public.  Crazy! Also, it's a good quality instant camera.  More options for lighting than I would have figured.  Super cute size pics.  AWESOME for our annual Halloween party and photo booth - leaving guests with a party favor.  Huge hit!
My daughter really likes this camera. She's been through 3 packs of film already!
Taking decent pictures and figuring out lighting and which flash to use takes some time to get used to but I love my cute little camera!!
This camera is perfect! Best gift I ever gave myself
very good
Awesome
My frist polaroid camrea and I love it! Aside from its obvious good looks , it's easy to handle , very light and portable.It takes very clear photos that make your skin look flawless! The photos are credit card sized so you can easily put them in wallet or create any type of project with them.The only down fall on this product is that the instax film can be a bit pricey....but aside from that I love this product!
We had this in our wedding. our guests loved taking intant selfies and we love looking back to them.
Love my pink instax camera! I get compliments on it all the time! The actual pictures are smaller than the old Polaroid camera's had but the final result is still the same. Beautiful moments captured in each photo!
love this camera. takes great pics. fun and fast.
Very easy to use and I got exactly what I ordrred
bought it for my daughter, she is so happy
LOVE IT!!! Cutest gift I've ever given for sure. It came well packaged, and came quick
Great camera for a 13 yr old, daughter loves it.
Great Camera
Thx Taylor Swift!!
I love this camera, it's great for making memories with friends and family. Everyone I take pictures with absolutely love it. The film is expensive apart from the camera, but you can find some good prices. Overall, it's a great camera, it's fun, easy to use. I'm happy with it.
Love this little instant camera! Its nice to have actual pictures instead of them being on your phone all the time
Teenage daughter loves this camera
Great service, great product
My 9-year old loves it. Film is too expensive and two of the 10 films did not work.
Price ti high
My daughter loves it
My daughter loved it no wonder it was the hot hard to get Christmas gift this year.
Great! Tks!
This is a really cool camera. It works great. However it did not come with instructions. THere are buttons/lights on the camera but I do not know how to work them. I have to look up instructions from online. It works great though. My daughter has taken several pictures.
Daughter loves it!
I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it.  The film is kind of pricey, but there's nothing like it.
Fantastic
Terrible, total waste of money!  My daughter took one picture and it broke.  The lights flash but that's about it.  What a disappointing Christmas gift!
great
she loved her gift!
Granddaughter loved it!!
All my friends have been buying these, and I had to jump on the band wagon. .. I love it! Super cute, takes great pictures and it's fun to play with!
great product and fast shipping.
Just started using this and it's soooo cool!!!! Film us very expensive, otherwise I love it :)
My 11 year old loves it.
This camera is just too cute! My friend has one of these and I immediately fell in love with it. It's easy to use and very compact. This is great for taking pictures with friends and family.
This camera looks and feels almost like a toy, but the pictures are great. I love it.
My daughter love it!!!
My daughter loved this camera as have all her friends and family.  It is simple to work and she loves the instant pictures!
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera. Yes, the pictures are small (credit card size).. but I basically purchased it specifically for my daughters birthday... Took pictures at the party and attached them on the goody bags so the kids would have memory of how fun the party was. I highly recommend this product! Shipping was fast, very easy to use.. It's just fabulous.
The shipping was really fast!! It's such a cute color works really good. I'm in love with it!
Loved it while it worked after a while it didn't turn on anymore. Only used it a few times even with new batteries and new film doesn't turn on anymore. I've never dropped it or got it wet.
This is a great Camera for any occasion. It is very simple to use. I totally recommend this camera!
Wedding reception fun for the guestbook.
My granddaughter loves it.  A little hard to find film for but otherwise well loved!
Awesome!
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my 12 year old daughter.She loved it!
On time shipping. Product as described.
good product
less than a year old now it doesn't work, ??? still under warranty, bought the extended will see how that goes, cute camera hardly ever used
The very best camera!
Exactly what my granddaughter wanted.
My daughter absolutely loved it!! Shipped fast...
Good camera ....Kids loved it.
I was leary about buying a camera online, and especially a Polaroid type camera.  This has exceeded our expectations.  This was a gift for a pre-teen, and she absolutely loves it!  Her friends can't seem to get enough of it either.  They are plowing through the film - ha!  Great camera, and comes in different colors.
I loved it came in sooner then I thought !!! -Ruth Palma
awesome
Love it but would be nice if it could download pics to the computer too.
Gift for my 11 yr old granddaughter. She loves it and has already shot up 4 rolls of film.
Shipped faster than expected. It's perfect.
Exactly as I (my daughter) expected. Nice camera for fun.
I love this camera! The pictures are small. The size of a credit card but they are just like what I remember. Everyone wants one for tier own fridge! Only down fall is the camera isn't as small as a digital or a cellphone so it's harder to carry around but it's totally worth it! Love it!
Christmas gift for  my 12 year old.  took tons of picts.  good quality. We (as adults) had a blast with it aswell.
Great Camera for someone young. The best quality that you could expect from a polaroid camera. It's light weight and fun to use. The film is sold seperately starting at $10 for 10 sheets. My daughter (17) is very pleased with it.
a gift to granddaughter - she's thrilled with it/it seems to take and print quality pics.
The camera is great! Took great pictures!
So Fun to Use!!
Bought this for my wife as a Christmas present. She loves it. Takes good pictures and ready in mins. Also allows me to laugh as she and my sons dance and sing around our house..." Shake it like a Polaroid picture"
Dont always use it but its fun
Great my Tweenie loves it.
works great. easy to use
very good product
Our 15 year old Great Granddaughter was very pleased with this camera.
Kids love the camera. works well.
I bought this camera for my wife for Christmas. She opened it up and tried using it right away. The camera flashed for the first picture (which happened to be a test shot). From the second picture on the camera will not flash and the pictures come out either completely black or very close to it. I tried to return the camera, but they made a policy that I have to return it within 7 days of delivery. Well, considering it was a Christmas present, I was clearly past that window on the day the camera box was opened.So I'm out the full price of the camera and 6 additional rolls of film that I purchased for it.
Cute little camera, kids love it.
We gave this to my 9 year old for Christmas (Winter 2014).  I did not realize the difficulty finding the film locally so I have to purchase it on-line.  The film can be expensive, your looking at a $1 per picture.  But the idea of an instant picture is just plain fun so it is worth the price.  We purchased additional accessories for this camera which include a** Strap : Camera Strap Professional Shoulder Strap for Fuji Instax mini 8 Camera (Yellow)** Case : CAIUL Transparent Crystal Instant Camera Case for Fujifilm Instax Mini 8** Album : Leaf Photo Album for Fujifilm Instax Mini Films - Mint** Decal : CAIUL Decor Sticker For Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 (Yellow)** Stickers : 20 PCS Scandinavian Style Films Sticker For FujiFilm Instax Mini 8 7s 25 50s** Service Plan : Canopy 2-Year Camera Accidental Protection Plan ($75-$100)** Film : Fujifilm Instax Mini Film Winnie the Pooh
Love love love works great love the color great shipping
Great product! Packaged nicely and unharmed!
I had bought this camera just 3-4months ago and it just suddenly just stopped working on me! Havent even used it that much! It still has a red light on the little hole where you see through but it doesnt have light for the automatic brightness. And when I try to take a picture, it really doesn't work! It says 1year waranty but I really dont know how that works or where to go! Am I gonna get a new one as an exchange for this crappy one that I have?
Good
Got this for my husband. He is in love with this product. Got to my house fast and easy. Would recommend this seller to friends and family. Product works perfectly, i love that i can snap pictures and have them right away. Thanks!
Great camera horrible description of what comes with the camera! I had bought one of these cameras for myself and much to my dismay, even though I read the item description and the actual box that the camera was packaged in when it arrived on my doorstep, there was NO FILM packaged with the camera! The online description and camera box itself both said it would contain 2 of the 10 packs of film. I was willing to pay more for the set! $20 dollars more! I was very disappointed that I couldn't use my fun new toy right out of the box.The camera works great and it very fun to use. As long as you have film of course!
I am thrilled with my new instant camera. I purchased it to use it for the guestbook at my upcoming wedding. The mini picures are wonderful and the quality is consistent with any I stand camera.
Great camera.  Love the instant pics and the automatic feature that tells you the best setting.
good
pictures are too small.  don't come out very clear
it was in mint condition and meet all expectations!
Love the price!Great present!
Fun!
I love this camera!!! I bought a lot of extra film for it with the borders and it's a bit addicting to take pictures. Be careful though as the pictures come out at a price of about $1 a piece. I like to scrapbook and this makes a great addition to my pages. Always looking for something different to  make things look interesting. I love the size and they also make great little party favors, if you have people over. Take a picture of them and give them the photo. It's very easy to use too, would make a great gift.
Just what granddaughter asked for
Excellent super happy. Bought it as a gift and they loved it so much. Excellent idea for any age and super easy to use
great customer service  great product
It's okay.I wouldn't want to rely on it for any important pictures. My daughters have had fun playing with it. Pictures are cute but you need good lighting.
Great product! My daughter loves it.  Was shipped promptly & in perfect condition.
Excellent all am very happy
One of my best purchase yet!!! I love it!!! Fast shipping and smooth transaction!
Fun camera
Awesome!
great to capture memories and honestly it is handy when you dont want to carry a huge camera.
Instant smiles
Instant smiles!
Good
My 18 year old daughter was thrilled with this gift. If you plan to purchase this, be aware that the prints are very small. They are not standard polaroid size.
Works as expected.
Does what its suppose to do.
Amazon delivered fast and camera works great! Nice picture.
This has been a fun and cute way for my daughter to cherish the moments with her friends.
Thank you for a promo delivery and the merchandise in good working order thanks.
My daughter really wanted this for Christmas. I ordered it a couple of days before Christmas and still got as promised by Christmas eve.
Awesome camera! My granddaughter loves it. Pictures are perfect! I want one for myself.
Only camera was delivered, no films came
Great product and shipped fast!
Works great and really cute!!!  Fun for daughter and her friends. Get extra film!!
Great product!
Great Xmas gift, my granddaughter loved it,esp the color.
I bought this polaroid camera as a christmas gift to myself. I love it. The settings are awesome, 98% of my photos turn out really well. I also like that the camera has a dial that indicates how many pictures you  have left in your film.
I love the camera.
Gift for my daughter, she loves it!! Easy to use and fun film boards have her snapping pics of everything!
Makes business card size pics, great for teen get togethers,...or other instant memories...
Nice!
Get the lighting right first when snapping pics with this camera. Film is about $1/pic unless you go with a value pack. Overall, it's girly and a lot of fun!
excellent
great price, fast shipping. thank you!
Camera was exactly as described and functions perfectly.  This was a gift and I was concerned about a timely delivery.  Much to my suprise the camera arrived earlier that the manufacturers forecast.
I bought the camera for my 15 years old dougther, she use for take pictures with her friend and family, after about 35 pictures, the camera does not work anymore. I reviewed if it could be returned, but with amazon you have only 30 days. The camera its on trending but think about before buy it.
This is a great and fun camera!!! It is easy to use and the pictures are really nice quality for such a small instant camera. I bought this as a gift for my brother and he loves it!! I would buy this again and recommend it!
Just plain amazing
Love the instant pictures! The pictures are just the right size and the film is very easy to load.
My teen daughter is having fun with this camera.  It is such a concept for her to have immediate printed pictures to share and hang in her room.  The quality is nice and she loved the cute grey and white polka dot strap that came with the camera.  Nice design detail.
my gf loved it!!
Gave to Grandaughter for Christmas. She was thrilled.
Got this as a Christmas present for  my brother and he loves it!
I got this as a gift for my tween/teen nieces; they love it.  It was so fun for them to have actual pictures of them and their friends to put up in their room.  It may seem like a dated idea, but kids rarely actually get pictures printed anymore.  They also really liked just using the camera and waiting for the film to develop.  They show me the pictures they have taken whenever I see them.  I highly recommend this as a gift for anyone.  I think I may also get my sister one to use at her wedding.
Camera kind of gimmicky not pro. but grandaughter was thrilled.
Best buy ever! I bought this for my 14 year old daughter, along with a bundle of fun film, and she absolutely LOVES this camera! It's so nice to see pictures of her and her friends in a time where most everything is only on phones and computers! I actually would love to have one for myself too!
Easy to use... Wish pictures were more 'crisp'..... But it is exactly what the soon to be newly weds wanted for their reception
Just as advertised. Worked great  out of the box. Teen loved it. Thankfully less expensive than in other sites.
The cover piece for the battery part will not stay on.
Love this camera!!
My granddaughter was quite pleased!
adorable but pricey
I bought this camera for my granddaughter and she loves it. It's a good camera that is simple to use and you get instant gratification. The pictures are very clear and the camera is easy to handle.
This was a Christmas gift for our daughter who is a photographer. She was beyond pleased with the camera and how well it performed. The price and prompt delivery was great! Thank you again!
just for kids
This was a Christmas present for my pre-teen daughter.  She loved it.  The photos it produces are too small for my taste, but they were perfect to her.  The pictures produced were clear and looked nice.  Just be aware that the camera is a little bulky and the film is a little expensive.
quick delivery and as expected
My 14 year old daughter loves this Christmas present.  Her 19 year old sister is now asking for one also.  Perfect size polaroid picture to hang on a string with clothes pins.
Loved it!!!!
exactly what my daughter was expecting
Taking photos with the camera is just fun.
Amazing! This was indeed worth the prize.
I love my mini polaroid! Just make sure to learn the settings so you can capture each photo at full potential!!
fun camera - remember it doesn't like photographing things more than a foot or two away
So cute and fun to have!!!
Film is expensive!
Amazing instant film camera.I bought it in the beginning of 2014, and it still works as if i bought it yesterday. I haven't even changed the batteries yet! I would definitely recommend this for everyone, it's so vintage, and cute. The picture quality is awesome, yet the one thing I dislike is where you look into the camera to see what you're taking a picture of, it's off to the side of the actual lens, so you kind of have to angle it a little more to the right when you're taking it if you want it centered. But yeah, if you're contemplating on getting these cameras, DO IT. You won't regret it.
Used this for pictures for a sign in book at my wedding. The camera is relatively easy to use; however the instructions are not super clear about how to load film and turn off the camera (to turn off the camera you push the lens back into the camera so it is flush). Guests had a little trouble loading film, but it didn't cause any issues at the wedding.
Excelente producto
Got it on time and it came well packed and not damaged at all so I really like this product.
Fun product and great time in shipping. Thank you.
My granddaughter loves it
Daughter loves her new camera!!!
Saved my daughter's Christmas! Had the last two cams in stock and arrived earlier than I thought was possible!!! The cam was her favorite present by far :)
Quick Delivery.  Item as described.
My Daughters loved it.
She loves the camera
My daughter who is 13 is the pickiest girl. She's difficult to shop for and she absolutely LOVED this camera. The color is popular and so cute. We got the accessory case an kit to go with it. Thank you for shipping it straight away.
My daughter LOVES it!!! Super cute and awesome quality.
My granddaughter loved it!
Super cool
Quick shipping-good product.
amazing product, fun and cute
Good
My teenage daughter loves this camera!
easy to use
My daughter loved it
My 5 and 7 year olds got these for christmas. They work great and they LOVE them. However the film is crazy expensive and this has proven to be a serious exercise in restraint for kiddos of this age. I'd suggest digital unless your kids are a bit older or not super into photographing everything cool they come across!
got this for my 10 yr old daughter for Christmas! she loved it!! Now she can take pics and give them to her friends and or hang in room. much better then boring pictures sitting on a phone
Good camera.  Provides a nostalgic feel with each picture.  Daughter uses this and takes photos of her friends.
As described,  received on time.
My daughter loves this camera. Very pleased with this purchase so far. Very easy to use. I purchased the pale yellow one & it's a very pretty pastel yellow. Looks great with the turquoise blue hard case we also purchased to go with it. :)
perfect
was a gift to granddau. she loves it. have not seen any photos yet.
Fun camera for tween daughter, although the film is expensive.
Perfect little instant pictures. With accessory package lots of ways to save and display the pictures. Camera and bag are well constructed and easy to use. My granddaughter  loves it.
I'm so happy with the camera.
I don't get the hype over this camera. It's very nicely made. It's super cute. But is a total novelty. It takes the worst pics ever. And the size of the photos are so very small. We have used it twice in 1 year. Waste of money unless your teenager.
I love it..
Great gift for my daughter she loves it.
So far so good.  My daughter loves her new camera.  Shipping was quick and packaged well.  Would buy again if needed.
Seems easy to use for my 9 year old grandson; however, I didn't realize the pictures are only the size of a credit card.  It would be nice if there was film available other than the mini.
Product came exactly as advertised. The description was clear and concise. The shipping was very quick.  My granddaughter was extremely excited and squealed with delight on Christmas morning when she unwrapped the camera.
I'm not sure if that's the one she really wanted, she may have to exchange it, but it is the one she put on her wish list! So that's the one I ordered!
my daughter loves it!!
Great camera comes with batteries and a rist strap
I love my camera it fun and captures the moments
So cute I love it :)
My wife loves it. Very hipster looking
My daughter and her friends LOVE this thing. Cracks me up that in this day and age of technology, this throwback 1980s technology is the in thing! Works well and takes decent pictures.
This little camera produces amazing mini photos. Our 6 year old granddaughter loves it!
I'm a huge fan of this camera and it's a really fun item to have around. I've only used it a couple of times and I think the quality is decent. The photos turned out well for indoor portraits. However, I tried taking a picture of a downtown skyline at night and the photo didn't turn out well at all. The flash was set on the lowest setting but the entire picture still turned out black. This camera is best suited for well lit situations or use of flash on close up objects. I wish it had a no flash option. The AA battery feature is also a bit of a hassle, so it'd be nice to see something that is rechargeable. I bought this used in new condition and when I first put in new batteries and film in it and turned it on, all the lights on the front and eyepiece kept blinking. I was afraid that I had bought a bad camera but luckily it worked fine with the switch to different batteries.The price of the film is also a huge downer. However, crutchfield and other sites sell it for around $14.99.**Edit:I ended up upgrading this camera to the Neo Classic Instax 90 which is more than double the price unfortunately but I'm hoping it'll be a better investment. The Instax Mini 8 is great if you're taking indoor photos of friends and parties but because my use was primarily landscape, the limited functions of this camera were hard to work with. I definitely debated whether or not to switch because this was so much fun to work with but if you're hoping to invest more in the photos then possibly this camera isn't for you or a DSLR is. It's also rather awkward and bulky. I did have a number of great shots in the small amount of time I had this though so it does the job for a low(er) cost!
I got it when the price was about $60 so I'm very lucky! This camera is perfect. When the photos develop it has a cute filter on it to always make your pictures look amazing.
This camera is awesome. The pictures turn out great! Perfect for someone who loves to take pictures and use them for crafts or give away as gifts.
I bought this camera for my 22 year old daughter and she has enjoyed being able to share her photos instantly with friends.  It's easy to use and a handy size.
So far so good, my daughter loves it. Having a hard time finding film, guess we'll  be ordering more online.
Loved it!
Very nice color of yellow and my daughter, 19, loved it. Develops pictures like a Polaroid.  Pictures are smaller, but fine with her! Picture quality is just like a Polaroid. Daughter loved this camera!
love it the best gift to buy!
This is a great camera, but the film is VERY expensive, making it unusable very quickly.
would have been great with a case.
Great camera.  In the age of cell phone technology, my kids love the instant'print aspect of this camera.  Its bigger than most of their high-tech gadgets, but they have fun.
I would rate this higher because my daughter loves it BUT the picture and the badly worded description implies that the film is included with the set. I found the camera for less money from other retailers but thought this included a pack of film. I realize it is my mistake but I won't  make it again.
There was no film with the camera or accessory pack.  We couldn't find any locally either.  What a disappointment on Christmas Day!
This was a Christmas present for my daughter. She loves it!!!
Quality of pics has not been good. Fuzzy. Item & film too pricey.
My daughter loves this thing. In a time of iPhones and selfies it's a polaroid that turned out to be her favorite gift. The only thing is an 11 year old that is always taking pictures on an iPhone needs to learn that real film costs money. lol. Great quality. She says it's the new-old big thing. Best Christmas gift by far.
The camera is an adorable size, but the quality of the photographs is definitely not what I expected. I actually gave it to my toddler as a toy, I used up all the film trying different settings but it just was not what I was looking for. The pictures are about the size of a credit card, and they mostly come out blurry and faded. I bought about ten rolls of film and went through it all so quick, but I've used professional cameras before, so maybe my standards are just too high. Some people seem to really enjoy this camera! If you've got the money to try it out, do, you may really enjoy it.
works awesome so pretty and cool and they ship is SUPER fast!! Love it
Purchased for my daughter and she has loved taking pictures and seeing them immediately print out.Very popular with the teenage crowd. Highly recommend.
Buyer beware! Very expensive film!
My daughter loves this camera. Easy to operate.
Nice little photos. Old style of no retakes. Fun
Pretty darn great for making memories.
I got this for my Girlfriend, for her birthday. She has always loved old Polaroid cameras, so when I saw that these mini ones were made, this was a no brainer. They produce a credit card sized photo, with a really great quality to it. Surprisingly high quality, in fact. The film refills are a bit pricey and can add up, but its worth it. This thing is fun and its really cool having these instant photos around for capturing those really dumb moments. Film will always carry more emotions/memories with it.
Its a gift. Didn't open yet.
This is the best thing ever. I LOVE IT. its better than other cameras. i wasnt shure of buying it, but its really cool. you get your photo instantaneously and is super cute.
Plastic cover for the battery broke off on day one, could not find a way to return or exchange the camera. Using scothc tape to keep the batteries in.
a gift for my daughter and she is having lots of fun with it.
It works beautifully, and the pictures are so cool!
My girlfriend loves it..however I did not recieve the film on time so we had to buy some at target which was ridiculously expensive.. almost 2.00 dollars a picture  yikes... still i recommend it..its awesome
I got a ton of compliments on it and everyone kept asking where I bought it Amazon of course super fast delivery over all awesome purchase
Came in perfect!
it's amazing!!
lovely camera
I wrote the camera review on the film recommendation space.  That's what you get for not reading first.  Life goes on.  My granddaughter loves both the camera and the film.
Awesome Camera!
Purchased as xmas gift for daughter.  Worked for less than a year before it became a paperweight.  Orange blinking lights, will not take pictures.  Appears to be a common problem with this cheap camera.  Time to see if the warranty will kick in
Gift for my daughter for Christmas, so not sure how well it works, but it definitely is cute.
It took long to get to my place but I'm so happy I got it cause it's so fun to use :) thanks it's worth it get one
I love this camera. I use my camera for pictures of my son all the time. It is easy to use and whimsical.
Granddaughter likes.
I think it's difficult to manage photos for a kid who is use to a phone. It's hard to take a good picture.  The quality comes out questionable each time.  It takes time.  It's just okay because it's not as easy to use and because of this, it sits in her room on her shelf.
This camera is perfect for creating an impromptu photo booth or just adding a touch of fun to events where the most used camera is someone's phone! I was really looking for something simple to use and this model definitely does the trick!
It's for Christmas and I haven't opened it yet.
The camera box was completely destroyed by water. The only reason I didn't return the camera was because its so close to Christmas and it worked, thankfully.
wonderful
Good buy
i wish it came with film...the camera works really nicely and the images are vintage but high in quality - the film is just  an added expense that adds up quickly. it should come wit ha at least a few
I love it so much I wanna buy them all! Lol it's seriously my favorite camera..
We bought this camera for our daughter for her birthday. It was a big hit with all the kids.  Picture just ok
I'm using it well~Thank you so much ^^
great product and seller
Super cute cameras, very easy to use, the pictures are small but they are great for cards, for crafting, love it love it love it.
This thing is awesome and really easy to use. I could see myself using this for a long time.
The camera is bulky and hard to hold while taking pictures. The plus is that everyone I took a pic of was able to take it with them as a token of the event.
This is a very basic Polaroid camera with very small pics.  It's point and click with only outdoor or indoor settings.  Flash is always on.  You load the film, matching yellow inserts to make sure it's upright.The pics are pretty good.  Total classic Polaroids, so forgiving unlike digital.  You can't see wrinkles on faces or zits. That kind of thing.We purchased some of the fun, creative films to make this even more cool.  We also bought a case to protect it while not in use as it's not the sturdiest contraption.  Just very basic plastic.Overall, my son loves it.  It's a great novelty item for teens or Polaroid lovers.  We are getting a wire to hang photos in his room.  Lightweight and easy to use
Great for kids!!
Great little camera..Love getting pictures instantly..Reminds me of all that was good about the Eighties.
It's prefect. Exactly what I want
But I returned it because the films are way too expensive. This camera was great. Had it in yellow, which was beautiful. I only wished the film would have been cheaper, I would have kept it.
Ordered a couple of these to go on the tables at our Wedding Reception.  Everyone LOVED taking photos all night and we put together a book after of all the pics ;)  Order LOTS of FILM!!! None comes with the camera.
Nice
Amazing pictures
love this productworks great, firm grip, easy to use
I'm inlove with this camera. I like taking pictures with it. I don't take pictures of anything random like others may use it but I use it during family occasions and holidays. It's great to a give a memory away to family. It feels like a toy but it's not :D
love it. i'll be a good Christmas gift,Thanks.
Love, I simply love it.
pictures are smaller than I thought though
Instant photos!!!
Love it
Took forever to get to me but when I got it...it was worth the wait.  Very fun camera
Works great!
Great buy! A lot of fun
Used this camera at work for a project and knew it would make a fantastic Christmas gift, bought two with loads of film. Recommend for anyone, fun at parties, for scrapbooking, really anything!
Delivered timely and worked as expected. Light weight and good price.
My granddaughter loved this.
Oh my gosh! Best camera! Everywhere I go people are so jealous from ALL ages!
Bought for my middle aged daughter.  She loves it!  Old school rules!
I love it.
Item as described, fast shipping. My little girl is going to love this Christmas morning.
Such a great purchase. Been wanting an instant film camera for a while and this was worth the wait! So easy to use. Creates fun photos. Always put the crowd in awe!
Not very portable, but a very nice and modern looking camera. The film is a bit expensive, but we bought a 50 pack so hopefully that will last for a good amount of time. Since the pictures come out credit card size, it can be a little small if you are taking a picture of something farther away, too bad there isn't a way to zoom. Also, Its kind of hard if you want a "random" person to take a group picture since with this camera, you have to be pretty careful of how you take it since the picture comes out right away, and you don't want to waste too much film. I reccommend to have good experience with photography if you are planning to get this. Otherwise, it's a very cute & cool camera.
my doughter loved, we have so much fun
I bought this camera in March of 2014. I am very pleased with how it has held up. The only problem I've faced with it is the camera did overheat while I was at Disneyworld and the photos couldn't develop because of it. That was my own fault though, since I knew that I shouldn't let the film or camera get over heated. My sister and friend also have intax cameras, and we often share the pictures with each other and display them in our rooms. I am extremely happy with this purchase. It made a wonderful addition to my camera collection!
Great and handy.
Very nice, came on time
Everyone loved this added little gift at the wedding. used it to take polaroids of my wedding guest. It was so much fun.
My girlfriend love it, creates great moments with it
I love love love my cameraIt's so awesome and easy to use.It works greatJust wished I purchased more film lol!!!!It's very cuteLove this cameraWill recommend this purchase.My hubby made a great buy.  Thanks
the pic came out not really good, the pics came out dark no matter I took them at night or day time. The color of the camera is cute though
when i first saw the camera I thought the films were gonna come with it. I was so excited, but all I got when I opened the box was just the camera, I was really excited to see everything together the camera and the films with it, I am disappointed  , Now I can't make memories with just a camera and no films to take pictures with.
Too expensive for this camera since is one to use only for certain occasions, but once is time to prepare the camera for that one special picture it truly does a good job.
My daughter loves this, it's amazing how we revert back to older type of cameras. It's allot of fun.
Quality of pictures in regards to color isn't great.  Not sure if it is the packet of film being used or the camera.
perfect christmas gift!
I honestly love this. I take it everywhere with me and everyone loves the photos. It's a great choice for anyone who wants a physical picture and not carrying around a bulky camera
I love my insta mini so much. Really great investment.
daughter loves it.
Love the camera!
Works great! I bought it for a camera for a "photo booth" at my daughters 20th birthday!
OKAY
very good
Nice camera for a young girl. I bought this for my 8 yr old granddaughter and she just loves it. Worked fine right from the first shot. Be sure to read the instructions BEFORE operating it and you will not have any problems. Also instruct who ever will be using this camera there is no second chance to erase and take another. Be sure of the shot and don't take random pics as you would with a electronic camera with SD card. Each photo will cost 50 cents or so. It's a re-learning thing.
Well made, sturdy and fit the description.  The camera worked as advertised and the pictures (although small) come out clear and bright. Love it.
i love it, everyone loves it too! They have asked me so many questions as where to get it, and how much. I dont think the price is too much, specially since ive seen it somewhere else for $100. Is $1 a picture too expensive? yes. But i still love it,, the pictures come out pretty good, just try not to take selfies.
love my instant polaroid camera.
Great. As expected
AWESOME! thank you!
Daughter was happy with purchase. . It was a birthday present and her birthday is on halloween. An extra film purchase is recommended. It was funny cause I had to explain to her that it developed its self. And boy did that make me feel old!
I ordered one INSTAX mini 8 and received it a week later in wonderful condition. It came in the mail and my experience with it after has been the best! Even though you have to buy film constantly it's very worth it because it creates memories that you can keep. PLUS it's one of a kind and makes each memory even more special. I love my instax mini 8 <3
Loved it
i love it
Love this item, Will make a great Birthday gift for my daughter!! Fast Shipping!!
I love this camera it's amazing!  If you thinking of buying one you should because it is a lot of fun
Just as other reviewers said. Its a bulbously looking camera, kinda playful, but everywhere you go with it people look. I love the reaction from waiters who we ask to take a picture for us - they always get really excited and loop back after a few minutes just to see how the picture turned out. Obviously it is a basic camera - you can only pick the ISO and the camera gives you a suggested number depending on light levels it detects, and you select the level by rotating the ring around the lens. Obviously you cant change aperture or shutter speet and you cant zoom - but thats beside the point, its a polaroid! The viewfinder is slightly off target but we have gotten used it it after a few shots. The flash is super bright so we put white cloth medical tape on it to diffuse the light, which works well. Also obviously in low light its not that great and the flash ALWAYS fires (cant turn it off) so watch out for whitewashing your subject and having black behind them - cover the flash a bit or have a light source behind you. In the same way, at night it cannot pick up buildings or fountains behind you if theyre more than 5-10 feet away. Daytime shooting in parks and streets is great. I havent tried the macro (zoom) mode yet bc I didnt want to waste any shots on things like food, but Id imagine that would be the only way to manually change the aperture so you could get that nice blurry background behind the subject. Maybe I'll try and report back.
Fun
Love it! It's small and easy to carry! It's also great that it automatically suggests which light setting to use.
Fast delivery, great camera.
Ehhh.
I bought two of these cameras, each for a 13 year old girl. The cameras were shipped quickly and the items were exactly as depicted/described. The girls love them and the merchant was great.
Love it!  Hung the cute pictures on a string around my mirror!
I had a few problems with the shipment but finally arrived with 2 days of delay. I love it! ❤️ It is so beautiful and it's the same color as the picture. Definitely my fav christmas present ever.
This is by far one of the best impulse purchases I have made in a while. It is extremely easy to use and the photos turn out great! Just make sure you have plenty of film on hand, because you'll run through it quickly. Everything you need is included with this purchase except for the film itself.  It's also less expensive to buy in bulk.
Fun!
The pictures are so cute. Although I wished it had come with better instruction (took me a while to figure out how to insert the films).
Felt like a kid again :'(it just reminded me with childhood. It produces excellent photos with a touch of old-look. I felt the photos were like 80's or 70's, which I LOVED BIG TIME.I kept taking photos for every single member of my big family, relatives & friends. They all loved it
nice item shipped fast
Absolutely love it!!! Awesome
Daughter loves it.  A little gimmicky, but that is expected.  Works fine.  Pictures are business card sized.
Everything was perfect
Daughter loves it and everyone we meet are amazed by it. The only thing is for those of us who remember the original Polaroids, the size of the picture was much bigger. Would definitely recommend!
the color is cute ,i buy it for my friend‘s daughter ,she likes  it so much .
As listed! Great service!!
Just as expected. Great for party's not so much at the beach but overall a great camera with a great vibe to it. Films a bit expensive but it lasts a long time!
Fun and cute
Bought it as a gift for my 16 year old.  It's been a great little camera!
OMG! I seriously take this where ever I go! I love this camera! It's my baby! It's so vintage! And the film you can buy for it is endless!  It's so light and easy to carry. Easy to use! A child could do it! It comes in different colors. There's many accessories you can buy for it. It's seriously a must have! My friends are always making sure I carry my camera on me at all times. Picture prints right there and then. Great quality! && they are perfect to give out. I've gotten many compliments! Only thing is, it works better when there is sunlight or just any light. When its dark it doesn't take the best pictures but other than that its awesome! Film is easy to put in and it's battery operated but it lasts for a good while before you have to change them!
works perfectly, great resolution! loved it for a photobooth
Had difficulties with opening the battery panel.
I t was a nice gift for my daughter. than you
Yes. INSTANT PICTURES. YES
My boyfriend doesn't like taking pictures. This camera changed my life now he loves to take pictures as we can have it at the moment.  I love this camera. It's awesome
Excellente!
This camera is a lot of fun. I decided to try it out and I'm very happy with the purchase. It's fun to bring along on travels for random snapshots. I am still trying to master the exposure, since it has minimal settings... but that's part of the fun, too!
Item came as described and works great. Really happy with it so far.
Wonderful !
I love this thing.
Awesome! Very fun and easy to use.
Ordered this for a Christmas gift, so haven't seen it in use yet. Im sure will work fine and my nephew will like it.
Bought for my daughters reception and what a blast people had with this camera, taking selfies and being able to write on the bottom of it to leave advice..  It was the hit at the reception
Works awesome! Love it!Have used it for several events and people like the mini size photo that pops out! So quick and easy! A great value
Amaz-Balls!
best thing ever
Very nice camera, which is mostly a novelty.When I was a kid, my parents (in the 70's) had a polaroid camera and we thought the quality was bad, but nowadays, my daughter who got this camera, in the era of 16 MegaPixel cameras on smartphone, think it is the coolest thing in the world.Pros:-Definitely has a novelty factor.-Nostalgics will love this too (I am one of them)-Great subject of conversation.-Due to price of films, you really value and think about photos you take (which we no longer do with digital equipment)-Good quality build.-Very easy to use.Cons:-This is a novelty item, so quality of photo is for a pure fun factor and is poor in itself (I take one star off for that).-Price of the film is outrageous.-Size of the photos are about 2.5 inches by 3.5 inches, so smaller than our old polaroid photos.
Easy to assemble and fun for a 9 year old.
this is the best one in the world
Bought as a birthday present - fast delivery, daughter loves it
My daughter loved this camera, lots of fun. Good quality.
Love it!!
Girlfriend loves this camera.....i don't get it
Oh what fun we've had with this camera.  It's very retro and it takes some time to get used to the sun settings.  You will find yourself having to retake a few shots while you get used to the camera.  However, my daughter loves it!
Beautiful and fun...
works great and was delivered very quickly
LOVE THIS CAMERA! its a bit bigger than I anticipated but great to snap timeless memories! The pictures come out tiny but great quality!
Good for girls
Keep in mind the film is incredibly expensive!!!
use this remember good time
Love, love, love this little camera!!!  Great pics if you pay attention to the settings (for light), and so much fun!  We use this a lot to take pics of my 10 year old and her friends so they can all have a copy to remember.  The film is pricey (about $1 per pic), but totally worth it for certain occasions!
Bought this as a gift for boyfriends daughter. She LOVES it! I think it's a great little camera for what it's worth... Polaroids, fun but certainly not digital. They are just as I remember - sensitive to too much or not enough light - except these pics are extra small making it more challenging to get a great pic. Hey, if she likes it, I love it!
Bought this for my 11yr old for Christmas and I know it will be the highlight of her Christmas Day!!!
Awesome camera.
super cute!! Absolutely loved it, its so easy to use & pictures come out great!
Our 14yr. Old daughter loves it so much! When she opened the box the day she got it our 16yr. Old daughter begged for one as well! Thank you!!
Great product.  Received very fast.  Highly recommend!!
My kids love watching their pics come right out, works perfectly
Luv the camera
We love it. Our friends love it. We are going to use it at our holiday party and give pictures to everyone.
A gift for our grandchild
catchers Ozel crazy moments is that a phone just can't do
I use it all the time. Film is expensive but worth it
I loved it!!
I used this camera at my wedding for guest book photos with fun props. Huge hit. I ended up buying two more as thank you gifts!
My kids love it.
excellent service and product....in love with my new camera!!!!!!
Amazing product! I ordered this for a bridal shower so our guests can take pictures of themselves. It was easy to use and the quality was perfect! I find myself carrying it around with me in my purse now, so I can capture memories in less than 2 mins!
love it!
Fast delivery. Product was as stated
im so getting it and its my favorite color...PINK!!!  my brother has one and accept its black i took a picture of me and it looked great!!!
i purchased hello kitty Instax and pink Instax cameras.  Both work perfectly. One for me and one for my 9 year old daughter.  We both love the credit card sized film. She's learned to operate and load the film herself.
I've only had this camera once and the battery compartment has melted into itself. I keep this camera in the same area where all of my other camera's are, in a temperature controlled room in our house, and they are all fine. Very, very disappointed and wasted money!
AWWWWWWEEEEESOMEEEE
good
This is such a fun little camera. It takes a while to get a feel for the lighting options and distances. It is especially versatile if you buy the accessories (different lenses). The picture quality is pretty clear. The pictures are about the size of a credit card so you can do a lot with them. I love it!
Great product. Very happy.
Everything was done on time and with efficiency!
Such a fun camera!  The film is about the size of a credit card and develops within minutes.  No shaking of the film is required.  Great to bring sight seeing or to parties!
I wasn't happy with shipping, it was late and it sat in a carrier facility for 3 days. The person I talked to from customer service emailed me back right away and was very very nice. So thank you for that. I love the camera, I've already started using it and it takes awesome pictures. The film is great also. Anyone looking to get this camera should get it, I got it for my smash books and the pictures and the perfect size so I don't have to cut anymore. :)
Great!
;)
A fun toy
Soooo in love with this adorable camera. The sky blue is just the prettiest color and my camera just fits perfectly in my hand. The pictures are just what I expected from a Polaroid style camera. But that's what I wanted for my art journaling. They were very clear and looked high quality don't get me wrong. But are not going for that look. Then this isn't for you. Best purchase for me tho. I just wish the film wasn't so expensive
Its suuuuper cute and takes cute polaroid pic! The only downside is that it is kinda bulky compare to a camera and a bit of a pain to carry around sometimes if you perfer small purses and the film is costly but besides that its a great product! You could also do a lot of diy projects with the photos taken too. And if youre not using it, it could also be a really cute decorative piece!
This product was very satisfying. I bought it for my friend for her birthday along with a twin pack of film and she used it for her birthday photos. They make almost any event look great! I am contimplating buying myself one as well. Also, its a better and cheap alternative to buy it on amazon prime rather than other places like urban outfitters or something that sells the same product for 100$.
Cute. My daughter loves this camera and uses it a lot.  Usually have to buy the film online. Some stores have it, but film is a little tough to find locally.Takes credit card polaroid pictures.
Love this cam. It is fun and perfect for events; wedding, birthdays, tracking your child from baby to adult, etc. However, not something I would use daily. Film is costly and using my phone and regular camera is more convenient and practical. Love the size of the instant print. Very cute!
I used this camera for a guest photobook at wedding and it worked great! I now have a great collection of polaroids from wedding.
Don't expect studio quality photos with this camera, but if you're feeling nostalgic and want instant photos reminiscent of Polaroids, then this camera is great. The photos are pretty small, but great for wallets or to post around the house or in the car. Great instant camera for those on a budget.
Beautiful and perfect!
Fun to have around
This was a gift for someone else, so I have no opinion, except that I would not want one.
Good value.
Bought this as a gift. Shipping came very fast and my friend loved it!
it is a great little camera ,and its perfect for what i need to use it for.  many thanks  joseph falzon
Best deal ! Yellow gets dirty quick so if you're active it isn't really the best color.
Exelente
It's amazing! I love taking pictures with it. it's convenient and adorable. It fulfilled my expectations completely.
Love this item! Very fun product!
I love it! Came in 2 days! I thought it would take longer. So cute, love it. Exactly what I wanted. :) completely satisfied and super happy!
Supercute, the quality of the camera isn't HD T_T But i still LIKE IT ALOT!!!!!!
I looked everywhere for this camera but no one else had it. i can always count on Amazon. The camera works great and I love it.
It's a fun, cute camera to have at parties.  My teens and their friends love taking "selfies" with this camera.  It actually produces mini photographs (remember those?) that can be put into wallets,  on the walls, or tape onto to scrap books.
I love it!! it's so cute, fun, and easy to use. Definitely recommend it.
I ordered the camera for my niece's birthday.  The camera came in perfect condition and works great.  The baby blue color is beautiful.  My niece loves it.  Competitive price & fast shipping from PlusDigUSA.
I honestly miss old school cameras. There's something exhilarating about not knowing how a picture will turn out after you click a physical button and the room fills with a flash. The anticipation to see how your photo turned out reminds me of my childhood, running to the picture section of Costco and hoping my eyes weren't closed in the pictures.Great value compared to most places I shopped and the camera is definitely cool. Purchased the Instax as a gift for a friend and she loved it. The pink color looked great and the material is a nice matte finish and doesn't feel cheap. Picture size is that of a credit card making it convenient to hang up anywhere and a perfect size. A ton of people complimented the camera and the picture quality is pretty good with multiple photo settings. I recommend watching some youtube videos for some tips on how to take a great shot with this little guy.
I liked this product has quality. My espectation was good.
This camera besides being so cute in pink works really great good price and good pics.  I used it for my birthday at a restaurant and it looked great.  Definitely worth buying
settings for shooting in various lighting is not working.
My sensor part does not really work!!!
Good!
Cool, Camera ive personally enjoyed it so far.
It was a gift for my daughter, and she loved! She is having lots of fun taking pictures with her friends.
love it!
Absolutely love it !!!
This little camera takes great pictures.  My son asked me to buy this for him - I didn't know anyone still made these type cameras. It was great to have prints to share immediately.
I love the colors, convenience, & flexibility of prints. Great gift for my scrapbooking teens!
It was exactly what I was expecting! I'm soooo happy with it! It's a short range camera. You have to be somewhat close to the te object or person to get a decent picture. But I still love it and enjoy it! It's fun (:
Love it
Love it
good
I don't even know what to say... I love this camera, it's insanely durable (I've dropped it a few times) and get complimented constantly. I can't express how awesome of an investment this was.
Love it!! A little difficult with sun, but it's great.
Love this camera. Takes a while to learn what settings you should use in each lighting so I generally prefer taking pictures indoors. Very simple settings though. Not a very hard camera to learn. I was worried it would feel cheap, light, and like a toy, but it has a god weight/feeling in your hands. Photos print right away but it does not come with film. Film can get expensive but I just like to buy on Amazon and if you think about it, back then we did use to develop all our photos. You just have to be mindful of what you take pictures of. The size of the pictures are like business cards. I was hoping for bigger photos but I thought this was a better deal overall and actually now love how cute the size is. I recommend this for all ages. I got it in a nice classic black color.
Exactly as noted in ad.  Fast shipping too.
I initially thought of buying this for a SoMo concert that was coming up. On the day of the concert, I brought this with me and it took clear, memorable, and awesome (when timed correctly) pictures! This is probably one of the best investments I've had so far. Excluding the fact that the film cost a fortune, this is a really great camera!
Love the camera. Perfect for college students to decorate dorm or apartment!
Good and versatile camera but film is far too expensive!
I absolutely love this camera! The photos are adorable and make amazing gifts. You have to remember that this isn't a digital camera and not every photo will come out perfectly. Sometimes the photos come out dark or not quite as expected but I think it's part of the fun. Most of the photos come out clean and have an an Instagram 1977 filter type feel to them. The outer case is a durable plastic but it will get a little scuffy if you aren't very gentle with it. The device itself is extremely easy to use. However if you want someone else to take your photo warn them that the photo will come out on top. I had a few kind strangers in NYC take photos of me and friends and they were all extremely surprised! I originally bought this as a birthday present to myself so I could look cool at Bonnaroo and this lil fella did not disappoint. Everyone loved it and wanted to know how they could acquire one. I took shots of strangers and gave them away as presents or used them to barter. People absolutely loved them. If you want to make friends at a music festival one of these is a must. Overall I think this is a really cute product. You may think you're buying a camera but you're really purchasing a conversation starter, present maker, and way to make people smile.
Good
My granddaughter loves it!
Came in short amount of time, thank you!
I used this for a party and people absolutely loved it!!!
Got it for Christmas it what she whated
perfect gift
It's perfect! It had nothing wrong with it the package was fine and I LOVE IT with all my heart XD
My daughter loves it
LOVE
Fun change from your regular camera.  It uses smaller film, works well!
Pretty awesome !
LOVE the pictures
Works fine, no complaints here!
LOVE IT! I got a white one and my family members saw and 3 other people bought it! Came on time and it was brand new.
Good little camera.
It's cute and fun. My teenager love it!
Love it
Loooove it
My granddaughter loves this camera. She loves to take pictures of her horse Willy.
I love this product. It's fun & always a great thing to have. Polaroid is back!
Love this camera
GOOD CAMERA!!
Gave this a gift to a 13 year old and she takes it everywhere now.
arrived in a timely manner and as expected
Great camera, compact and does just what I had expected! Would also make a lovely gift for someone!
Absolutely adore this point-and-shoot camera :) simply click the button to open the lens, allow the camera to suggest a flash setting based on the room brightness, and take the picture. Pictures always turn out wonderful, but avoid taking snaps of bright objects or sunny areas. The flash cannot be turned off so these areas might come out washed out.
I have one in pink but sometimes when I take a picture it doesn't come out. Like it comes out blank . What do I do ?
LOVE this camera. It is so cute, and although it's quite expensive to keep taking instant photos with, they almost always turn out cute.
I love it so much
so cute! so tiny! so perfect!!!!
While I am still working on how to take my best pictures (with the settings) I love this camera.  My first picture was awful but it has gotten better and better since then.  Very unique and perfect size.  Yellow is also the greatest color, love the retro feel. I also love all the photo ideas that it sparks.  A great little birthday gift to myself.
Works perfectly; had no problems setting it up and I mean it's such a good and cute way to capture memories.. I LOVE IT!!
so cute ! I love it!
love the camera.
This was a gift for my sister and she loves it!
I loved it!!
Delivered quickly and works perfectly
Nice product, like the vintage quality of the photos. Just wish the film could be printed on larger paper, prints about the size of a business card.
I love this
Nice for kids
cant wait to use this for the wedding we are doing a photo guest book!
...i love my new camera!!!!!!!!X3 i take everywhere =D sometimes some pix don't come out like i want them to :/ but most all of them are pretty rad. I love my instax.X3✨  perfect gift for anybody.
really love it
Very fun
I love this camera so much! It was the best thing I ever bought on Amazon. I honestly take this everywhere with me! It was love at first sight.
Used for our wedding reception. Loved the ease of use and it takes good photos for an instant.
FOR THE PRICE I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING A LOT NICER.  FEEL VERY CHEAPLY MADE. HOLLOW PLASTIC, FILM IS WAY TO EXPENSIVE. A DOLLAR EACH
Love it and fast shipping!
I LOVE THIS CAMERA
She begged, I folded.  She loved it and dropped it accidentally.  Lens cover and an internal part went flying.  Now DOA.  Heartbroken kid.  Not the camera's fault but shouldn't it be able to handle a simple fall?
Love this camera it's so much fun, I used it at my baby shower as guests walked in, they had their picture taken and put in a little scrap book where they wrote to my daughter. It's not going to take the most amazing pictures but it's super cool and easy to use, for things like that or just for fun. Kids especially love to play with it (It's pretty durable so don't be nervous about having a kid hold it), the film is a bit expensive but I think it's worth it :) everyone loves when I bring it to a party, I can easily take their picture and give it right to them. This camera honestly is more for fun than anything else really and it gets 5 stars from me for doing just that
Perfect amazing I love it
It's soo cute ♡ it's great ! Very happy
Cool little camera. Bought as a gift for my 13 year old daughter and she is thrilled with it.
This is so much fun at a party!
My brother love this camera, I gave to him in her birthday
Love it ! Fast shipping too!
I love it! The pictures are great. It took a few wasted pictures to get the settings right but once I did they've all come out great. It's also a great conversation piece. Everyone has something to say about it!
my girlfriend love it so much... nice look and easy to use. than yoy
My daughter loves this. Camera
Camera doesn't change modes. It's only stuck on one. Not satisfied with the fact that's how received it. Possibly defective
It's so cool!
It's great! Thank you (:
I used it for our wedding guest book. It was not a traditional reception so my sister took photos for the guest then they pasted them on a piece of card stock with their congratulations/words of wisdom.First of all it was super easy to use. Second, it took great photos, perfect size. It took me a long time to buy this camera because of the size of the photos, I thought the photos would be to small; I was wrong. The credit card size is perfect and adorable. Lastly, I had numerous guest ask to buy it after the party and/or where I got it and how much it is. I will not be selling it, I actually can't wait to take more photos with it!!
Small and easy to carry around. Takes lovely and clear photos. Prints are a bit expensive, but cheaper than Polaroid film, and if you buy it in bulk, you can save a lot of money. It's a really great camera. Only cons are are that you can't shut off the flash (i've had to cover it with dark tape sometimes) and the view-finder isn't centered with the lens. But other than that, i completely recommend if you want really adorable photos and love the versatility of having you pictures printed wherever you go!
I love this camera! It's the perfect size, takes really great pictures and is definitely worth the price.
This isn't a fancy technical camera but is great for taking photos at the spur of the moment. It's wonderful to have the picture developed on the spot instead of having them stored on your digital camera.
Oh god, I love this product. It's lightweight, resilient, takes AMAZING photographs and is just all around the best purchase I've made.
Nice, inexpensive instant camera. After using it for two packs of film I wish I had gone for the 210 wide version just for the larger prints. Kind of tricky using outside as exposure setting changes quickly with slightest movement of the camera. Inside, no problem. Flash fires all the time, would be nice to be able to disable if you wished to.
So much fun! Love my instax mini!
It's exactly what you'd hope for - It's simple, easy to use, and actually pretty cute. It takes a while to get used to the light settings (7/10 of your first photos may look over/under-exposed), and it's a little bulky, but overall a great product. I wish the film was less expensive!
I love it!
I bought this for my girlfriend as a gift and she loved it! Great for taking pictures of moments you'd like to keep in a scrap book or a wallet. Subtracted a star because the film can be pricey, around 70 cents - $1 per shot.
This was a complete was of money.  There is a reason that polorid cameras went out like a blink of an eye.  No matter what setting I used all the pictures were horrible.
I just got this camera in the mail, and I don't know if it's fake or not, but it doesn't say Fujifilm in the corner like the picture shows. The box is also different. It takes nice pictures inside, but I already blew through 3 packs of film trying to get a nice picture outside, and they all come out very over exposed. I'm going to try with the rest of my film to get it figured out, but very disappointed what I got is different from the picture. I have a feeling it will be returned.
Love this camera!!
It was fun once we fried out the exposure issues. We took it on a 16 day trip to across the country to Yellowstone. The girls, 4 and 8, lived capturing their adventures and seeing the results right away!
The camera itself is perfect and so cute although it has a fault. The veiw finder is not centered
LOVE IT!!!!
Incredible! VERY easy to use, and although most of the instructions are in Japanese, there are plenty of online tutorials showing you how to use it. Don't let the few poor reviews stop you from getting this camera. It is worth every penny!
What a fun camera! We are now back to Polaroids! Watching the picture come to life is fun. The small size (about the size of a credit card) makes it easy to bring on trips.
Exactly what I wanted
HORRIBLE waste of money.
Great little camera
exposure is bad. from going to just even a toy film camera to this...It's cute and I get my polaroids but if you shoot sunsets, the whites clip with a black dot on the picture! It just really doesn't expose itself well either for being film...But it's cute and does its job
Got it EXTREMELY fast! It's for a bridal shower, it's easy and fun to use. I just love it!
Awesome!! works perfectly!!
I bought this camera because I'm a scrap booking junkie. The camera works great and is fun to take pictures and watch them develop. Also, the photos are small and easily "smashed"!
i love it so much the picture is better when the background its darker as the flash works its magic..... ran out of film and it sucks.
Excellent!!!
Awesome
This item was horrible I should never bought this cheap I i bare used and it broke.
its my favorite cam!!!
Love this item. Fun
For fun it is great. And my daughter enjoys it very much.
Great camera for the price. Going to use it at our wedding recption. We'll have guests take photos and add into the guest book.
I recently purchased this camera for my daughter and it stopped working after about one month.  We loved it at first, but now it completely stopped working! It won't take pictures, it won't do anything.  We have changed the batteries, changed the film, etc. Nothing.  SOOO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!  Now Amazon will not allow us to return it because the window for it to be returned was four days ago.  SO ANNOYING!
Excellent little camera! It's super cute, and super efficient! Better than what I expected!
My daughter love it ...
Love it!
So much fun to use!! Perfect for celebrations. Used it at our wedding and we love our photos:)
ExcelentThanks
Everything I expected and more, great gift
This is basically the most adorable camera on the planet. I'm a professional photographer, but I wanted to have this as just a fun thing to use at my Lolita meetups.Pros: This camera is adorable and easy to use. Because it is a new camera, the film is also much easier to find (and much cheaper) than traditional instant cameras (such as Polaroid). There are also a few different settings available, so you can theoretically use it in brighter or darker settings. It is also MUCH cheaper on Amazon than what it costs at Michael's or Walmart.Cons: The settings are not FULLY manual. You have the option of indoors, outside/cloudy, outside/kind of sunny, outside/very bright, and Hi-Key. The biggest con here is that I don't think the settings accurately reflect how they're supposed to be used. For example, on a pretty overcast day, I chose the "cloudy" setting, and the photo came out way over-exposed (as though it were much darker out and needed more flash). I'm still getting used to figuring out what constitutes as "cloudy", but I kind of like the over-exposed look, as it is more flattering on skin (blows out any imperfections), and gives you that old-school feel of a less-than-perfect camera. I'm still giving the camera five stars, because I would rather an image be over-exposed than under-exposed, and I have enough setting choices that I think I can figure it out eventually.Pro/Con: The camera, in my experience so far, seems to take the best photos indoors, which seems to be the opposite of most cameras (digital or film) out there. Just an interesting point to note.I think this camera is pretty awesome, and I may be buying more as Christmas presents this year. :)
This was a great camera for just the fun ability to print photos on spot! Although the instax mini does not take high quality pictures and will overexpose your photos at times, it is still really fun! To keep in mind when buying this camera: It is more a toy than a "photography camera". It feels plastic and fairly cheap (probably because it is) and if you drop it you may just no longer have an instant camera. But if you just want it for the fun of having a polaroid it suffices! I have had a lot of fun taking snapshots all summer, and it's a great this to have along for the ride, to capture moment, right in the moment. I have really enjoyed this.Also, do keep in mind that the film is about credit card size.
My daughter loved it. Thank you.
The pictures don't come out as great as I thought but it still does the job :) and it's cute
I love my camera, it is compact and take great pictures :)
Great camera! Super easy to navigate, great pictures!! Absolutely LOVE IT!
It's good, I like it.
Quite the hit at the wedding.  I wouldn't use it as an everyday camera because it can get expensive but it did what it wanted and pictures turned out well.
The product does not work.......
cute color and easy to use after you get used to the flash/environment settings.
This was the best idea for a teen party! They sure loved it and I do too.
My daughter just loved it..
Very fun and easy to use. Still getting used to the settings to use in different lighting. Also, the film count seems to be off frequently and I've prematurely exposed some film thinking my Instax was empty, or missed a shot thinking it still had film in it. Batteries are still kicking after about 200 pictures (it uses classic AA batteries).
I love the camara! It's cute and practical and takes much better pictures than you would expect but only if it's in the right conditions which I why I don't give it a full 5 stars. Overall, it's a very fun, artsy, and unique camara!
Takes me back to the old days! I recently moved out of state and my friends borrowed my camera and made a heartwarming album...Love it!
I love my camera everybody wants me to take their picture and it's very cute I love it a great buy
I love this camera, takes good quality pictures and fun
Great and a cool little camera
It's really worth your money. Just don't waste the film because that's what costs a lot. I guarantee you'll enjoy this camera!
Just what i was expecting.
OK camera films too high.
film is costly
This camera is great for my project life.
believe me, you need this in your life. has worked perfectly so far, has had it for over 6 months now and still hasn't had to change the battery. films are super cute and come out perfect every time
For a year now, I've been eyeing this camera ever since I saw youtubers showing it in their videos. I finally bought it and its definitely worth it! I love the colors it comes in and I got the yellow one! It's the perfect size to carry around while traveling and it's really fun to use just to take random pictures of friends and families (: does not come with film btw. People complain about the film price but its a Polaroid camera and buying film is part of the investment of having one. This camera if for the people who want to take photos for fun and not for business (;
I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee My new camera!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its greattttttttttttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What can I say..........My grandaughter loves it.  Ordering from Amazon and I checked many places...they were the cheapest!
This straight up old school camera was a hit with my tween daughter and her friends.  It is available in a variety of colors, but strangely, did not even come with a basic case.  It takes decent enough pictures, but it is mostly for the instant gratification factor for a generation growing accustomed to just that.
The pictures are all dark
It's like way too cute!! I can't wait to use it:)
great product !! bought it as a gift .. received as descibed .. thank you
Love this.
I LOVE this camera it is perfect for taking cute little pictures. I have no complaints and I came just in time -Suzanne's daughter
The camera was amazing and I'm so happy with the results !! I really recommend this purchase and I promise I'm not lying.
Very happy w/ product
Love this camera. Feels great to hold. Really hard to see through the lens viewer but everyone talks about it when I use it and wants one ;)
I am not sure if it is the camera or the film, but the photos are AWFUL.  I took them in with the sun out, at sunset, with the flash and inside and  you cannot see anything.  Such a disappointment.
I purchased this camera for my daughter's 11th birthday and she absolutely loves it.  We were able to pop in the batteries and the film and start taking photos immediately.  She and her brother were amazed at the picture appearing "magically" on the film in just a couple of minutes.  The pictures are about the size of a business card and the quality is very good.  It's funny, but I think people look better in these photos ... 16 megapixels really doesn't do anyone any favors!I did purchase several packs of film and accessories to go with the camera including a clear hard plastic case that snaps around the camera with a neck strap, a snap-on lense with a little mirror on for selfies, a pack of decorative stickers to put on the camera body, and a photo album to hold the photos. It was such a hit that my son has asked for the same setup for his 9th birthday coming up in December.  I did caution my daughter to "conserve" the film.  Both kids take photos on their tablets and tend to take random multiple pics of all sorts of inanimate objects but she's been using her film wisely so far.  And speaking of film, the Fuji tends to be cheaper than the comparable Polariod film.  I averaged $.75/photo and I didn't see the Polaroid film on Amazon cheaper than $1/photo even when bundled.  We'll be giving the kids film as gifts for holidays going forward (Xmas stocking stuffers, Valentines, Easter, etc.).I highly recommend this camera.  Any adults who've seen it and our photos so far have been completely charmed!
My daughter loves her new camera! It takes nice little pictures.
I'M SO IN LOVE WITH THIS CAMERA! Fast delivery and very well packaged!!! Well trusted seller! A+++++ Thank you so much!!!
Super great, totally recommend if you're trying to look for a instant film camera. I love the quality!
Great product!
PERFECT
Love it. My daughter is having so much fun with it.
Great "Instant" camera, finally a replacement for the old Polaroid. Have tried the Impossible Project film in my old 600, but too many problems. This little guy performs beautifully, just have to be conscious of the settings, an instruction book would do wonders for this camera, hint Fuji? Only complaint is the photos are a tad small, but are excellent. They do sell a bigger version, but the camera is so big and unwieldy that you won' take it with you. This little guy is GREAT !
use it all the time. a fun camera to capture the moments!
Got this for my girlfriend because she really wanted it, I got her this and she got the film at walmart, and she absolutely loves this camera. I would reccomend this
LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera! I've only had it for seven hours, but I can already tell that I love it! Super cute and easy to use. I love the vintage look to the pictures. The one downside is that it can only hold 10 pictures at a time, and the film is kind of expensive. I wish I could afford to just snap away at every random thing I see, because it is SO much fun.
I love this camera
Works amazing!
Love this Camera, so cute!!! and Fast Shipping
My older kids love this, but I wish instead we got one that allowed you to preview the photo before wasting expensive film on bad photos. Of course, then it's not a true polaroid, which is what they were after. Oh well.
good
If your looking to take great photos this camera is for you . I have so much fun taking pictures. Its small so you can take it anywere.It took about 3 days to get to me . I really recomend
super fashion
Looks nice and works great. Bought it for a gift, they love it. The film that you need to buy to use it is kind of expensive, but it's not for daily use, just to capture a special moment, so it's doable.
Very good~!
great camara take good care of it it can get dirty easily
It was a great buy
Great price and super fast shipping
It was aweosme it works so we'll
Everything that was expected and more, great buy
Nice and simple to use. Can bring anywhere. Light and colorful!
Love it.
AmazingCame in two days with the free shipping!!!Everything about it was amazing only thing that sucked is that it doesn't come with the film. Other than that I highly recommend it!!!
I love my instax mini 8
Great!
Fun instant camera ... price was  amazing  on other website price was a lot higher. Arrived faster than predicted in perfect condition works and I love it. Thank you
I love it. I take pictures in every moment that I want to keep and remember. The film is pricey but worth every penny. I would recommend it to anyone.
Takes great pictures when it is cloudy. Even when set on sunny the sky can become white.
Before it arrived, I thought, With advances in photographic technology, the pictures from this device must be extraordinary, if small.  The pictures are as instant pictures always have been, only smaller: a disappointment.  The camera comes in a cute little box but is too large and bulky and just oddly dimensioned to be very cute itself.  It does not fit the hand(s) well.  If you thought of buying this camera as a gift for a child, you would do better to find a better instrument (in terms of what it can do).  This camera will not of itself open vast worlds of creative exploration, as the right camera can.  I had thought it would function like the Kodak Brownies of old, bringing high-quality photography within the reach of just about anyone, but it does not.
love it!
Great product and transaction.
LOVE IT!!!!!
Was fast and exactly what I ordered
good
I bought this camera as a gift for my cousin's 21st birthday. She's only used it three times and it broke. No matter what AA battery she uses, there is always a red flashing light on the light adjustments and a red light at the view finder. She's even looked at the manual and changed the battery accordingly (change the battery while the camera is still on, and leave it so the flash could charge). It's been over a few days and it's still flashing. This camera is cute and simple to use, but it doesn't seem to be as stable as I had hoped it would be, since so many people has bought and raved about this device.
Amazing cam and always complimented on the photos!
I love this camera it's co cute/kawaii I love how it looks on my desk and I love the small pictures it takes I colors are all cute and the picture quality it's really great. I haven't used it as much as I thought I would but still enjoy it a lot
Awesome ty
Clear picture.  Films are cheaper than old polariod cameras.  Only problem is that view finder doesn't match what you need to capture.  You have to guesstimate and hope it turns out good but it's good for selfies, even though I'm not all caught up with the whole selfie thing.  I believe an awesome photographer won't sink to that level .  The other problem is when you set it to the right environment light  for oustide, the background is completely black.  So just leave it for indoor setting.  I wished I had purchased the black edition instead of the whiet because there's more visible dirt.  Either than that the camera is pretty awesome to take that old school polariod shots.
Loved it! totally worth it! :)
Everiting good
Do not buy this product. You can not find film! :(
This camera is absolutely adorable! Polaroids are really making a come back! This camera is portable, easy to use, and a pretty great price compared to the prices it's sold at in stores! Highly recommend, love this camera :)
Love it~!! it was perfect
cute camera, sturdy build and everything. if only the film wasn't so expensive! however, you really need to learn how to use this camera with the whole lighting exposure settings. some of the first few pictures i took ended up way too dark or too light, even though i followed the light indicator. all in all, a great purchase, and would make an amazing gift.
It is so awsome I got it for my 12th b-day do cool your daughter or son will like this if they're into photographing Great price to iwent to Michael's craft store and it was 119.99
Perfect! Very satisfied!
So beatfull
I use this camera to take pics every few weeks in order to keep monthly journal/scrapbook for each of my kids. Makes it so convenient in a time where we have so many digital photos that we tend to store and not print out! Love this camera! A classic with a modern look!
Really fast shipping!!! I totally adore this camera. However, it doesn't come with close up len which is for taking selfie.  It doesn't matter that much though.  The camera is really light and easy to use. I am going to bring this mini 8 to my boyfriend's house during this Christmas and create some special memories with him. Can't wait !!!! Love Fuji insta mini 8 !!
My family loves it!!
The camera was for my 12 year old daughter..it's super cute! But unfortunately, the quality was poor. She was only able to get about 6 pictures out of it before it started malfunctioning! We're going to try and fix it, but I have a feeling it will be returned.
Just like the old Polaroid except the mini version. Pictures  are the fun size, Easy to operate, but not as compact as I would have liked.
This is such a fun little camera! I love the blue color, it is so pretty. Picture quality is decent;  for the price and for all of the things you can use the pictures for, it is a fun camera to have. I use the photos in my project life albums, in my planner, and hanging up in my craft room from a long piece of twine (with cute clips!)
Really cute pictures, easy to use, a bit hard to take pictures of yourself with, but otherwise a great camera!
Great and fun camera! Used it to capture 'vintage looking' moments leading up to our wedding!
Nice exactly as shown in picture
I used this as a guest book at my wedding and it was perfect. Great price, great pictures, and just fun to have.
My only problem is that it doesn't have an option with NO flash. But overall its a great instant camera.
The camera works really well except the only annoying thing about it is that yes it does come with the batteries for t but not with film and the film is the quite expensive part.
Very good. Thanks!
Purchased as a birthday gift for my 16 year old granddaughter. She loves it and went through 5 packages of film very quickly. Thankfully, she has slowed down a little! Her friends love the pictures and the quality is very good for a small instant camera. It definitely beats the quality that I remember from the old Polaroid cameras of 20 years ago and how you had to swipe them with a pink thing to protect the image. These pictures are very nice, a little small, but just the right size for her generation.You can also purchase the film with different borders and she loves that aspect of the camera. The pink color is perfect for her, it's small enough to carry in a purse or backpack and takes a lot of abuse without having. I was skeptical at first but her and her friends love it and several of them have even purchased one. A great buy - papa did good!
Very retro!
I used up about 7 shots until I got the hang of it w/ the lighting I was using indoors, because the initial photos were too dark or had unacceptable glare. But there is a separate instruction sheet regarding the use of a feature inexplicably called "Hi-Key." This is the key to good indoor shots! First you let the camera settle on its automatic lighting setting, & then you move the lens to the "Hi-Key" position (not the "indoor" position). This lightens up the indoor shots. Once I figured that out, all went well. I used it to take photos at a special event for a non-profit organization, & asked for donations. I had a large '59 Pink Cadillac standee that people stood behind while I snapped a photo with the Fuji. Worked very well. young kids especially liked the "magic" of the photo developing before their eyes!
Best contraption EVER! We bought this to use at our wedding for a sign in book and the pictures are so cool. They obviously look older and not anywhere near high end photography but that is what we are going for. Super light and durable.
Great camera!
Happy with the Product but disappointed it didn't come with film. The Film doesn't seem easy to find either. Havent gotten the film yet therefore haven't been able to use the Camera yet.
Great fun for our daughter! Works well, easy to use.
It doesn't tell me what setting to put on, even outside it just stays on indoor and it's been doing that since I got it so it's not broken. I'm gonna return it bc I wasted so much film trying to see what was wrong with it
My daughter loves this thing. Film is expensive but you can save money buying in bulk.
Im in love with this camera!
Its a pretty cool camera, my daughter loves it, it was a gift for her birthday, thanks.
Perfect camera for a teenager! We got this for our niece and she has not stopped taking pictures. Her creativity has been sparked. Easy to use but obviously has some photographic limitations.  Film can get pricey.
Everything was good
Easy as ever to use and a nice small size for traveling. Would warn the user to make sure your aperture setting is lined up to the light - I forgot to check before I took a couple photos and they came out too light. Other than that I love it!
This is an AWESOME camera for a great price. I got the pink one and it works like a dream. It comes with a wrist strap in the original, authentic box. The camera body is sturdy plastic with a smooth matte feeling and though it's a little awkward to handle when you first get it, after you play with it for a while it's just perfect in your hand. The view hole and the aperture don't line up perfectly, but with a little practice you can take professional, beautiful pictures that are easy to display and give to people.I recommend this as hands down one of the best cameras I've ever used. Instant film is just nostalgic and Fujifilm nailed it. It doesn't come with film, but the five-pack box is a really good deal. I also bought a small instax mini photo album to keep my pictures in.Best purchase of the year!
Such an awesome camera. Lightweight and just as i expected. Make sure to let your picture develop in the dark or it won't develop! The suggested settings aren't always right so you need to find what works and what doesn't but it's fairly easy to do so. Would definitely reccomend!
Great pictures and good photo resolution.
This was a perfect camera for sleep away camp where electronics are prohibited.
The product is quite wonderful. It's a great size; it's very light and small enough to fit in my purse. The photos are vintage-y and surprisingly good quality. I'd been warned ahead of time that Polaroid photo quality was terrible, so I was pleasantly surprised by how my first photo turned out. Granted, they aren't the quality of a Canon EOS, but they're still very nice. They are on the smaller side, however. They're about the size of a credit card, not the slightly larger ones usually associated with Polaroid photos. The camera doesn't come with film, I realized. For immediate use, purchase the film packets and the camera at the same time. The camera is very easy to use. Just click a button, and the photo slides up at the top. Overall, it's honestly one of my favorite purchases. It's a lot of fun, and it gets a good response out of people around me. With realistic expectations, it won't disappoint.
Cool camera!
This is my first time EVER writing a review on amazon, but I just wanted to let anyone know who's curious about this camera that it's a GREAT purchase! It came the exact day it said it would and takes awesome pictures! I absolutely love my fuijifilm camera! I just got it yesterday and I can't wait to start taking photos of memories and with friends. This is a great investment!
I'm in LOVE with this camera! I've always wanted a polaroid and was very indecisive about which one to get, but I definitely don't regret getting this one. There's different settings for brightness and it's a bit confusing at first, but if you read the manual, you'll be fine. Not only do my pictures turn out great, but when I'm not using this camera, I set it on my desk and it's just such a pretty camera.
It's a really cute color and at such an affordable price! I wish Fujifilm would make more colors though. I will definitely buy another camera if they make a lavender one!
very adorable
I love this camera! I have wanted a polaroid camera for a while now, and when I saw this one, I went for it, and I think it was a great investment. Easy to use, cute and takes good pictures!
Nice!
I love love LOVE this camera!! Great price, fast shipping! I love that you instantly get a picture, very good for having an instant keepsake. The credit card sized prints are perfect for keepsakes, memory books, and party favors! The picture quality is pretty decent for an instant camera that has automatic settings. The pictures come out clear and have a unique look about them. Very simple to use. In some situations, the flash is a bit bright, but some masking tape over the flash will help dull it, as well as give a unique filter to the shot. And you always get the 'wow' factor when you snap an instant shot on a night out.I would definitely recommend this product!
The film size is actually very cute but FAR too expensive, restricts use of camera to very special/novelty use.
Awesome and practical
This is the same camera that everyone wants but costs less! There are no zoom capabilities. Just point and shoot.
for our hollidays it was good
Saved up for this beauty and it was worth it! The pink camera online looks a bit too toyish but in real life it is a pastel pink that is super cute! Some people might say this looks like a toy camera, but hey, at least when you bring it outdoors theres a lesser chance of it being stolen cause its a "toy" appearance! Came in a solid cardboard box and safely bubble wrapped. Includes 2 batteries and manuals. It's a great camera to have! I love everything about it.
The 12-year old granddaughter loves this little camera.  The film is a bit expensive, but this age group loves the pictures they get and they can put them in their scrapbooks.  It is a clever, little camera, perfect for younger kids.
Amazing and just right!
i like
I love this camera for take and give photos, I just wish the lens was a little better to give a little sharper pics. It's ok, and I suppose that adds to the charm but I wish I would have bought the $150 one which gives a little nicer results.
Great little camera! Fun and easy to use! Perfect for all occasions!
Love it
Great and fun camera!
Love this camera, worth every dollar
Excellent!!!!
This was a birthday present for my 13 year old granddaughter. She loved it. I was surprised at how clear the pictures were.
Works great!
Bought this for my daughter's birthday.  She absolutely loves it!  Who would have thought kids today would like old school type cameras.  But it's cute and takes pictures almost like a photo booth but you don't have to be sitting in it.
Amazing Camera! Shipping was so quick! I ordered it on a Tuesday and it arrived on Thursday! I would definitely recommend!
Absolutely the best purchase I have ever made on Amazon. This is the coolest camera, and all of my friends are jealous! The film is a little steep in price, but I buy the film on Amazon so it's not so bad. But if you're thinking of buying this product, I recommend it! It's especially great for parties and wedding registry ideas.
i like it
LOVE this camera. It's so cute, and it's just awesome taking instant credit card sized photos.
love it just what I expected
Love my new instax mini it is adorable just like the picture I ordered the camera and the twin pack of 10 film things in each, got all of this for a great price can't beat that anywhere else, shipping was fast and my items arrived safe & sound :)
Amazing love it !
Love my new camera!
Im a photographer and this is one of my favorite cameras!
Fun little camera! My teenager loved it
Just received my camera and live everything about it! oh! And also amazing quality pics!!
Very easy to use! And it's fun!! Came very very fast also!
Cute fun
I purchased this camera and film for my granddaughter's 13th birthday, she loves it. Just wish the pictures were larger, like the old cameras.
Best purchase ever <3
My daughter absolutely loves it!
I love the camera, but I really ended it for a specific event and when we ordered it it said the camera would be on time and then we called and they ensures us it would make it in time for our event. But it didn't show up until 3 days after
I was looking for a camera to just take Polaroids and save them for memories. Then my friend showed me this one and i fell in love immediately. It's perfect. Photos are smaller than regular Polaroids but I think that's what makes them special and cute. Quality is fine. You have to realize is not a digital professional camera. But I love how old and vintage the photos look.
I love it! It's working very good. It is a good product! I recommend.
I am smitten with this Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Camera.  I owned a Polaroid instant camera as a teenager and used it all the time.  This camera is so cute and light.  I purchased the baby pink color.  The photographs are credit card size.  This camera is a great Birthday or Christmas gift.  You can use the photographs as place card settings at a dinner. You will love this camera.
Love the color so much
It's so cute! I am having a lot of fun with it. The pictures aren't perfect as the digital camera but they still look great.
Really glad I bought this polaroid. Went on a weekend trip to Philly with a few friends and brought this camera along. We had an awesome time taking some vintage looking photos. The film is about the size of business card, and the photos come out really beautiful! The camera senses the type of setting you're in and shows you what the camera should be on. Definitely saved us on wasting film. Really light weight, and beautifully made.
love this camera and works well. only thing i dont like is the auto-flash (yeah i know i know) cuz i actually like to adjust the light settings manually.
So glad that I bought it! Does exactly what I wanted and the price was right.
This camera is great! I've already snapped so many photos and it works very well. No problems at all. Easy to load and operate. One of my favorite purchases
Pictures come out so well! And it's adorable! The small size makes it easy to carry with you wherever you go!
love it
Love it!!!! So cute and perfect
I love it the color it so cute! the pictures come out so good!
Love The camera!
Great!
Love it cutest camera get so many compliments only down is not so great in dark areas
Amazing camera I love it!!!
(:
Love it
Instax mini 8 is great. I dont have any problen with it. But 'fujifilm' is not written at the write place as it is on original fujifilm instax 8. So i think it may not be original but its quality is good also shipping is fast and true color
Pictures come out beautiful. I bought this for my daughters future wedding and we tested it out and took a few photos. She loved them. Will use as a extra camera for the photos taken with props.
Great camera...love it!
Excellent conditions
I absolutely love this camera! I just got it yesterday and it is just wonderful so far. (: It looks so classy and take wonderful pictures. The setting help a lot too. Just don't forget to order film when you order this because its doesn't come with it. (:
So far no regrets! My daughter loves her camera. To me the photos are small and not very clearly focused, but my daughter likes the small size and believes the not-so-sharp image is what makes the photo look retro.
Fun little camera. Got exactly what I paid for and I am happy.
Fits the description
It was great!!
I am in love with this camera!! I was bugging my boyfriend about it an he got it for me as a birthday gift and its both the best choice and worst mistake he has made because it keeps me happy but my film supply is paid for by him :) everyone always has something cool to say when i take it to parties and everyone loves taking pictures so much sweeter than a camera phone
Super freaking cute~ for my 13 year old sister, and even for myself. I bought it originally for me since I was in love with these. My little sister wanted the blue one and I had originally at the end loved the yellow color. I love the pastel colors for the polaroid cameras! they make them even cuter with that e girly touch! I just bought a yellow one -lol 5/5 Product!
It is very simple to use, and is an eye catcher. I love to use it, It makes me really happy. Well worth the money. Don't buy it at Urban Outfitters.
It's super cute!! It is in perfect condition and my new favorite thing !!
It doesn't take pictures at the beaches, don't try you'll just waste film. But overall it's my bestfriend I love it.-Why take a picture with your phone and eventually delete it when you can freeze a moment and keep it forever. Yes, they are such things as digital but some people are too lazy to print them at a store that they store them in a computer and forget about them.  Why go through the same struggle when you can have it printed right then and there?
Great price! Love it!
Best purchase I've ever made. Absolutely love it!
I love this camera the photos are so clear and vintage looking
daughter loving her instant camera, very cute too :)
So cute!I love it! I can't wait to accessorize mine! It's also super easy to use and the manual gives good tips and is an easy read!
My daughter loves her new camera and is quickly learning how to become a great intstax photographer!
Was gift for granddaughter. She loved it.
Came super fast and everything was just perfect. Highly recommend it.
This is wonderful! I bought this for my daughter and she loves it!!!
I can't believe I wasted over $90 on this camera. I'm sure there is just something wrong with it. But when I got it last month, I got all excited for nothing. The camera wasted many of my films. It only takes pictures indoors when it's dark. When I tried going outside to take a picture with my friends, the film was just blank.
Surprised my daughter with this camera and she loves it!  I love all the different film options. Very easy to use and so much fun!
Perfect condition!
Great camera! So much fun, you just have to learn how to use it correctly. At first you may waste one, two, or three films (which are kind of pricey) trying to figure out how to use the camera. Do not open the back once you have inserted film!!!
I love this camera! It's just like a Polaroid but the pics are credit card size. It will be perfect for my event.
Awesome! Fast shipping...great quality!
I am having so much fun with my Mini! It truly was a great purchase.
Very cute, delivered on time, exactly what I expected. Took another rater's advice and purchased twin pack film, best deal.  Perfect for a 9 year old girl.
Was my granddaughters request but when it was paired up with the case and album it was more than she expected and is loving it.
I love my instax mini!
It was for my daughter who is 13 and she loves it. It certainly is a novelty item though. She has used it pretty much continuously. It is basically a polaroid type camera, just a little smaller.
Great! !!!!
Unfortunately it didnt work, I put the battery and did all the instructions on the paper but the adjustment lights keep blinking and the view light is red I tried new batteries but nothing changed what is more disappointing is that I shipped it internationally so it is hard to return it back also I dont know if I can trust buying another one and facing the same problem. If anybody have an idea on how to fix it pls help
I bought this to make decorations for my dorm room--it works great, the pictures come out really well (except sometimes when I take pictures of my kittens, but that's because they move so fast), and it only takes about 3 minutes or so for the pictures to develop. Only problem is that I can't figure out how to turn off the flash, but that's probably just me.
My daughter loves this camera!
This is a really cute camera , it doesn't come with film, (I read discription) but it took so long , it was supposed to come 5 days before but it had a delivery attempt which sucked, but it's a cute camera , I'll probably order film from here
This product is fun. The only thing that's annoying is the light setting. The camera change's it's preferred lighting often and you have to make sure you change it to that setting before taking the pic.
the kids loved it
I am so inlove with my camera!It's the best.
In  love with my camera! This camera shipped very fast! It's fantastic bought  this camera because I remember the 70's ! I will be taking this camera with me everywhere I go.  Only issue is that the film is very expensive, one dollar for photo.. But is you are a creative person this camera is for you, because is ideal for scrapbooking.
It is actually a really good camera! You can take really beautiful photos and they come out perfect. But I only have on complaint. When you take a photo of for example a sunset, and point directly at the sun, the photo doesnt reveal. And blue dots appear on the paper... :/
LOVE THE CAMERA. I wish the pictures were bigger but I did know that they would be credit card sized before I bought it so I shouldn't complain.Best money I ever spent. I've always wanted a polaroid but they are much to expensive, this is perfect.
Good.
i love it...
it was awesome
in love! This camera shipped very fast! It's adorable & such a lovely shade of pink! I will be taking this camera with me everywhere I go. The quality is great!
My sister loves it. The only thing she wants is to be able to turn the flash off sometimes
So happy I got this camera! Works well and isn't complicated to use. Been using it with my friends and my fiance. It just has that fun nostalgic feel to each photo. :)
LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera!  Perfect for any occasion! ♡♡♡
I received my camera on Wednesday & I ordered it on Sunday. It came super fast & it was padded real well. I've been debating on getting one but it's well worth the money! The only thing bad is how expensive the films are!! Save your films & buy when there around $13! Not $20!!! Super easy & I'm very obsessed with it ! Will be buying as gifts for people!
love love love it!!! and fast delivery..
Great value for $
Awesome little camera!! Its fun and easy to use. The small circle in the view finder in my opinion is not really centered when the actual picture comes out. Therefore aim slightly above the little circle and your pictures should come out just fine :)
Colors in picture are not good enough, picture size is too small & some times it gets stuck, not satisfy at all with this purchase
Bought this as a gift for my niece and she loved it... great gift for a teenage girl!
My sister loves it!! Better & cheaper price on here than urban outfitters!!
Had so much fun with this on vacation. Film quality isn't very good.  Lighting has to be just right.
Keep in mind it shoots out very very small photos
It produces pictures too small than my daughter thought!
This is such a fun camera and our four year loves to have pictures immediately, rather than wait for mommy to order them. I used the pictures from this and a "smashbook" for a guest book at my sister's baby shower recently. It was SO awesome!! The guests all took pictures with my sister and then decorated a page in the book and wrote a note for mama and baby for later on. Totally recommend this camera, it is so much fun.
I bought this camera and the blue case for my granddaughter for her birthday along with a variety of film. She loved it and immediately began to take pictures.  Great purchase for a 13 year old.
The camera is fun and I love making excuses to get a chance to use this :) my only complaint is that it's very hard to get a good picture indoors unless it's well lit. Even if the subjects come out well, the background might completely be dark. Or the background is fine but the subjects are freakishly bright. Also the flash is always on, haha. But I guess that's just how these Polaroids are so it's not really the Polaroids problem. Overall, it's doing exactly what I bought it for, so I can't complain :) it's lighter than I thought too
Came with batteries which was great and an adorable little wrislet so you can hold it on your wrist. The pink is such a pretty pastel, I regularly get comments on this camera. What a neat vintage idea this camera is!
I am totally in love with every photo that I take with it. It's very easy to operate and absolutely worth it.
Great, fun little camera!
Very trendy. Daughter loves it. Got to play around with distance and lighting so get extra film.
Very pleased
Easy to use & very handy to carry or in your bag. Fast startup.
its all fun time again with this camera XD small easy, of course the film is pain to pay off, but hey if u love fun stuff, and don't expected super high quality photo..its instant camera...mean to be a fun camera :D
excellent. was big into polaroid but couldnt afford the film from overseas thru impossible project. this is an even better alternative
This camera made me excited as a 5 years old child. I recommend everyone to buy it and enjoy the memories!!
Gave it a 4 star because I didn't know the pictures would come out so small but it's still a good camera and I use it would recommend if you dont mind the pictures being on the smaller side
nice product
great
Love how you can take a picture and have a concrete copy of it on the spot! The only downside to this is that the film is a bit expensive, but it's worth the fun you'll have with this camera. Super careful packaging when it arrived and on time too! Everything about this camera is amazing.
best thing i purchased !!
Perfect conditions and resonable priceing. Best camera i've bought.
its a hit!!! everyone loves taking mini photos!!!! great at parties!!
Love it! Film isn't too pricey either!
Its very hard to take a good picture. The instructions are not easy to follow. You wasted a lot of expensive photos to learn how to use the camera. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
Loved everything about this camera.  The pictures come out great! it really exceeded my expectations!
AMAZING! so cute! and so cheap! had to buy one for my friend and one for myself! the light sensitivity switch is a bit odd since that light on there doesn't move with you when switching to another mode but it works just fine, just a lil design flaw, not a product flaw. It's kid friendly and elderly friendly. anyone can use it and its pretty enduring. ONE SLIGHT DOWNSIDE: the peephole where you would look to take a photo of someone else is kinda off. sometimes the angle on point and some times its off. because the actual lens where it takes the photo is so far away on the camera from the hole you look through, the angles are gonna be slightly off all the time (better for selfies and closeups). but that is something that can be corrected over use and familiarity of how the angles work.
I Love ItI Love ItI Love ItI Am In A Honey Moon With My Camera!
Its soo cute i love it:)
Bought this as a gift for a teen. Been working well for over six months now.
The flash in the day time outside isn't nice but the overall quality is nice.
The best camera ever. It is great.
Super cute photos from a super cute camera. I get compliments on it and I am always asked where I got it. Although the camera feels almost toy like, the pictures look great!
This camera works well for taking pictures at birthdays, special events, and silly pictures with friends and family. I love how the film is cheaper for the polaroid instant film camera. I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants an instant print camera for fun. Totally worth what it's priced.
Good product,  fast shipping!
Was so happy to get such a good price and fast shipping,it was as said and pictured when revived, it was a present for a friend but she said she loves it. Very happy
I bought a camera like this 1 week ago and the print card is not in it. Please call me at 4352244388.Thanks.michelle nordmark
Good camera takes decent pictures the flash is not as bright as a you wanted it to be also turning it on you have to pull the camera lens which I think is not as smart because it may damage it but it does the job
I bought it as a present for my best friend and it was SO CUTE! Everyone who sees her with it end up wanting one too, me included!
We had a lot of fun with this camera at my wedding and we also have a nice archive of pictures that were pasted into the guestbook. I guess my only qualm about the product is that I don't imagine using it a lot in the future; it is large and the film is somewhat expensive, so it sits on our shelf for now—perhaps we will revisit it.
totally love this camera, super cute and super fun!
Love this. We are using this for taking pictures for a guest book at our wedding, and of course we had to give it some practice before the big day. We've thoroughly enjoyed taking pictures with it. The setting indicators are really helpful -- and so far they have always been correct. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fun and easy way to take snapshots
Does its Job.
Two thumbs up 
I LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!It's the first polaroid I ever owned, and Im loving it. It's adorable, light weight, and easy to use. Play with the settings a bit, and get yourself familiarized.
Good
I bought this camera for my birthday, it came in as expected and in great shape! The only down side to it is Amazon gave me the wrong order. I ordered the original version camera and i have the recipes on amazon to prove my clame. Amazon unfortunately gave me the limited edition version which you can buy on Amazon, this disappointed me because i didnt care for the poka dotted arm strap, i just wanted the original arm strap version (limited edition was cheaper so didnt get fair sale). Also the labal on the front right ONLY says Instax mini 8. Ive done my research well enough to know its suppose to say fujifilm instax mini 8. The only reason why im giving this a 4 star is because it works great as original, its just not what i ordered. I still wish i had gotten what i paid for the original, but i guess this'll have to do.
used for our destination wedding photo booth and it turned out great
Love it! Cute and trendy camera.
Okay so this Polaroid is amazing. The shipping was fast and it was 100 dollars well spent( that's including two boxes of film and taxes). The quality is great. I wish I would have gotten a different color but that's my fault lol. It kind of looks too childish for me, I'm already 19 and look 16 but any who... It is super easy to use and I am so excited to use it this fourth of July weekend.
Awesome
Such a cool little invention! My daughter LOVES this thing, when she's a good girl I can get her film!
The Fujifilm instax mini 8 that I got was a Fake version of the original one from Fujifilm. The camera that I got looked exactly like to real one but it clearly said on the box that it was made in china -,- I was really upset. Fujifilm is a Japanese company and it makes no sense for it to be made in china. Also the lettering on the camera in the front does NOT say Fujifilm it just says instax mini 8 . I'm clearly unsatisfied with the product and sadly I had to return it.
It's so exciting and fun when taking pictures with this instax mini 8 camera! ;))The photos come out crisp, clear,  and very well detailed. Good for a very cheap price. Had to mess with some films a little to know how to control the lighting and composure, a tad bit difficult. Used about 17 films after just receiving it (so much fun!). The films are so pricey but it's worth the money. Cute yet very trendy right now, especially for the teens. Loving the vintage look, was hard to look for these kind of cameras nowadays.Edit: For people who are saying the fujifilm camera is fake, it clearly says fujifilm on the top where the picture comes out.
Love the cute camera. Saw it at a friends place, got it and it is so adorable.Everyone around me loves it too. Brings me back the old film camera days
Cool camera for fun pics. Not for taking a lot of pictures unless you have a lot of refills. Pictures are size of a credit card and good quality.
Bought this camera for my daughter's wedding reception. We heard of others using the camera for guests to snap their picture and hang them up. Kind of a different thing to do instead of a guest book. So after purchasing the camera and film, we really didn't know how to display the pics in a way that would please us. Decided the whole idea was stupid. As the wedding approached we were going to just ditch the idea. Since it was to late to return the camera we reluctantly decided to make something anyways. So we covered a foam board with photo album paper and added burlap lace over that, inserted the board in a 24 x 36 frame. We used spring loaded mini clothes pins to hang the pics. Figured that was the end of that....nope it was a huge hit. EVERYONE loved it!! The pictures are really cute and the guests had fun taking them. The camera was in demand the whole night and guests were waiting to get a turn. We just let it float around, no need to monitor it. The quality is not bad for a poloriod camera. (And we are a family of professional photographers.) The pictures are about the size of a credit card  and the camera is simple to use. Anyone can use it. So glad we did this, definitely recommend this camera!
Ahmazingggg.. i have been wanting one of these cameras for a while.. i had actually been looking for a vintage instant camera.. i saw this and fell in love... the pink is alot brighter online but i knew it would be and i wanted the more pastel pink! I love the matte finish of it too! It comes with batts and a strap also! It came super fast, a day earlier then i thought it would! they packaged it nicely and securely. I am so excited to take some great pics!
I gave it to my daughter as a present and she loved it. She would take pictures with her friends and the places she goes to. She would take pictures for memories and decorate her room. She said it was the best and its really easy to use. If you have a teen age daughter I would highly recommend it to you.
I bought this camera for an upcoming trip because I wanted something a little nostalgic that was easy to carry around. While it of course did not replace having a digital camera, it was fantastic. I'm still learning what the best settings for the light are, but so far I've gotten some amazing and unique photographs. Plus, I'm able to give pictures away to the people who are in them as a wonderful little souvenir. The film develops clearly and the camera is small enough and light enough to put in a medium sized purse. Children from elementary to teenage years think it is the most fascinating device and LOVE getting to watch the film develop and keep it. Although, after a week of camping it's looking a little worn. I don't mind, but if you're not one for dust or finger stains and don't want to have to wipe it down a lot I would recommend a case or a different color.
I absolutely LOVE my new fugifilm! I recently used it at a bridal shower for the photo booth and it is brilliant!! Everyone asked where I got it from. The only doenside is how expensive the film can be. The film goes fast because of all the fun to be had!! It is definitely a good time for people of all ages.
Love it! Got to my house very quickly, within a couple of days! Resonable price and the camera works great. Only knocked off a star because the white is a little bit hard to keep clean. Always touch it with clean hands.
What I really loved was how fast it came in ! I was going on a trip to disneyland and was hoping it would come in before I left and it did ! Very happy !
just wooow. i love taking pictures with my boyfriend with this camera they come out so perfect amazing memories to hold
I adore this camera. There is something so great about being able to take a picture and not being able to edit it or slap a filter on it. It just is what it is. The film size is also perfect for wallet photos too!
Color is good, photo quality is great. Cannot focus on objects too close to the camera (within 1 meter). Another problem is what you see in the viewer will shift a bit to the left on the photo.
Excellent product and I really liked my expectation filled the qualify because everything arrived as requested I really I liked all the pretty enough to recommend to all the community through Amazon not change. would recommend vendor to other to purchase their much needed items, i really like the service and the products that i have received.
My 11 yr. old son saved his money to buy this instant camera. He really has a blast using it. It's so easy to use. I'm considering buying one for myself. The pictures come out really neat. He loves it.
It's a very good camera you just need to take pictures in a very well lighted room so the pictures, good otherwise the dark and look like pictures from the 70s. Also the pictures are small so make sure that you are aware of how small the pictures
I love this thing. I am definitely not one of those canon camera type people. Don't get me wrong their pictures can be beautiful but I enjoy the convenience of not having to upload photos, fix them, send them, and pick up and pay process. Let me just say, I never develop them. Plus, if I want a detailed pictures to look at I'll just take it on my I-phone where I can control a lot more, duh.The quality of the pictures is really cute and slightly retro looking. The camera is always catching peoples attention especially because it looks like a little toy. And I have so much fun taking pictures with my friends. The only down side is you can't make copies of that one photo, I guess that's an upside too, you have fun trying to recreate that photo. This camera is also really convenient for travel, I think people wont try to steal it as much since it's not a professional camera. It's a reasonable price on amazon and if ever stolen the robber will have to spend more money to get more pictures.
I really like the item, it was in mint condition but I wish the film was included with the package instead of buying it separately
I LOVE IT SO MUCH!! THE COLOR IS SO BEAUTIFUL! ALSO IT CAME 4 DAYS EARLIER THAN WHAT I EXPECTED. I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT! IM SO GLAD I BOUGHT IT!
I bought this camera for my 13 year old daughter and she loves it. It is nice size and just what we expected. Pictures come out nice as well.
I absolutely love this camera! It is just the cutest thing ever, and the picture's come out great! I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!
Camera was the hit of the party along with a variety of props....instant Photo Booth!  Everyone had a photo to take home to remember the event.
I have been looking for a polaroid camera for ages and well, a lot of them are pretty pricey. I have seen these cameras all over the internet and noticed that many people have been buying them. I decided to take it upon myself to purchase one as well and let me tell you... I was not disappointed. This camera is easy to understand and its cute! What more could you ask for? The pictures may be small but it is a MINI instant film camera for a reason.I say buy it now! It's great! <3<3<3
i ordered.this beautiful camera as a birthday gift for my daughter and it really arrived  on time so my daughter enjoyed it present and I am a very glad daddy. Thank you for this Good product and delivery.
once you recieve it is great but it did take forever to receive but it is very nice and alot of fun to use
I had major envy when my sister came home with this camera and its so AMAZING I had to get myself one. The look and feel of these photos are so cool and vintage i love them. Worth the buy for all ages.
amazing camera love how nice and clear the pictures come out is also a very good price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love the size small and cute
I love this little camera and it's a great camera. It's perfect for decorating and scrape booking. If you are into crafts and looking to create vintage look I would recommend this camera!!
This camera is very good quality for the price. I love the colour and the pictures come out great (just make sure you use the right setting)! The only downside is the price of the film but overall great purchase!!
I liked this camera a lot. Well, any Polaroid really. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that it's a mini. I would try to take a big group picture but it wouldn't get everyone. So I ended up selling it, since I couldn't return it, and bought a Hello Kitty Wide one and I have no regrets.
using at my wedding for a "photo table" item.. .and it is perfect! My colors are blue and white and it is perfect!
My youngest always wanted an instamatic film camera. Told her good luck because they don't make film anymore for them. (we have an old one). Surprise! After searching on amazon, found this one. It fit the bill because it also had to be pink. She really enjoys the camera and her friends have had fun sharing the pictures.
This thing is like my baby! The pictures are so fun. I got it as an alternative for my Polaroid Land Camera, since film is much more pricey for it than the Instax mini. Super good buy; the camera is light, adorable, very portable, and easy to use. The only thing is when I switch modes, the light doesn't move too. It still functions the same though :*
absolutely love this! shipping was super quick and the camera was packaged well! also the camera is amazing! loved that it came with batteries :)love love love <3
Arrived a day early and in good condition. I was worried it would be too small at first but it's actually just the right size! All I have to do now is wait for all my film to come in tomorrow!
I love it so much!!! People and my peers compliment my camera a lot. I'm so glad i purchased this item. Keep up the good work!
I went on a vacation and my son really wanted to take a picture of the beach so he went up on the balcony WITH THE FILM INSERTED and took a picture that never faded in i think its a waste of money.also the way you hold it you have to put your finger on the front of the camera which will cover the flash, or make it horizontal, I really dislike this camera and think no body should buy it.
It arrived a day before the estimated time it was delivered. I love how small and light the camera is. I thought it would be bulkier and wider but the size is really nice. I hope to take a lot of photos to make some memories. Going to be a new hobby from now on. I just hope to get reasonable priced film for it in the future.
I bought this for my 8 year old daughter who wanted a Polaroid camera for her birthday.  After doing some research, I discovered that the film for the Fuji is much less expensive, even though the camera itself is a bit more than Polaroid. She loves the size of the pictures & adores the pink color.  I am beyond satisfied with this purchase!
the color of camera is very nice, it a good camera, I think you will like it, just the film a little bit expansive.
Love the camera, its easy to use my granddaughter is having a ball with it and now her friends are buying them too.
I got this camera as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it. It is a very nice and simple camera that is very fun to use. We been using it pretty much all the time and it does take some nice photos. I would highly recommend this product to anyone !
Good. The style is awesome. The product has been easy to use. Looking forward to capturing more photos in the future.
i love it! great packaging and cant wait to capture memories.
Nice product and great color! Bought it for my girlfriend and she loved it. It is kinda heavy, but useful!
I have no issues with this camera. The color is beautiful and it takes pretty good pictures. It is also simple and fun to use and very nostalgic.
Prefect gift for any pre-teen/ or teenager. Takes great pictures. There's a variety of different film borders that can be purchased.
I love my new fuji camera, I missed having these around. It really does help catch that one exact moment
I purchased this camera in the pink shade. I heard so much about this cameras all over the internet. I love the idea of snapping a photo and it comes out right away. This camera is pretty easy to use, there's only two buttons (start, and snap). You can twist the lens to adjust the lighting (which can be tricky to figure out in the beginning). Sometimes if the lens aren't adjusted to the proper light setting, the photos may come out too bright or too dark. Another defect is, whatever view/angle you see in the lens, the photo comes out slightly shifted to the left, because of the placement of the lens (you look into) and the camera lens possibly because of different locations on the device itself. This camera comes with a wrist strip and two batteries. (No film is provided, you must purchases separately). Overall, I love my camera! It is perfect for the summer time, captures every moment under the sun.
I got this for my roommates birthday and this was so cute! She kept telling me how much she loved it, definitely recommend.
Skeptical at first but its officially clear that I'm in Love this instant camera! Although film is practically a dollar per photo its definitely worth it. Since you have a hardcopy for yourself you can keep your photos in an album or wallet for years.The sizes of the photo are quite small (wallet size) but thats what makes them adorable. I took a selfie and gave it to my boyfriend and he loved it and decided to keep the photo in his wallet. I love how its easy to use to camera and its pretty lightweight. Worth every penny and wonderful for keeping those special memories. I love how this camera make everyone look good. Regardless how awful you make look this camera filter is somehow able to make someone ten times better looking. Make sure not to waste your film as much. I only take photos on special occasions or date nights:)
This camera is so easy to use and so much fun. The best part is getting the pictures right away! I'm so used to taking pictures on my iPhone and never getting them developed but now I can take a fun picture and have it that instant...so cool
Love this camera.  It's mini pics are just adorable and it's portable as well.  I am thrilled with the quality and the nostalgic feeling it gives me.
Purchased for bridal shower, wedding, etc and really love using this camera. The photos turn out great just learn how to use the light settings
What a fun camera this is!  Photos come out clear and are a great size for shoot-and-take photo memories!  The camera was recommended to me by a photographer friend and I am happy I followed her advice!
This instant camera was just what I expected it would be: cute and brings people together! My friends loved it and we have such a great time in parties taking pictures. Everyone wants to have one, haha. Just be sure to adjust to the right/recommended aperture setting or your picture will be ruined.
I love it! I've always wanted a polaroid, and this is perfect. It's super portable and the mini film is so cute! I like to decorate my walls with them. I get worried about getting the camera dirty though, since it's white. But it's actually still very clean, just don't be rowdy with it and what not. The only thing that sucks is that you have to be careful with the lighting! Sometimes a picture will come out completely white or black if the setting isn't correct. This isn't one of those automatic things, so be sure to set it correctly!
I am in love with my new camera. I take it every where I go. It is great for capturing moments in a new way.
I got it delivered really quickly and was so so so so excited when I did. It's light weight so I can carry it everywhere and I even bought a little messenger bag to carry it in. The film comes out quick and the pink color is really settle. Would get this again for a friend.
I bought this instant film camera because she has been bugging me about a polaroid camera. I bought this one in particular because of the reviews. Overall she is very pleased with it.
i do NOT recommend this to anyone! i got it a week ago and it has been broken for half the time ive got it, so about 3 days. there are dots all over every photo that comes out. DO NOT BUY
My fiancé bought this for me and I am obsessed! I already had the 210 for about two years but I wanted the mini to take to parties and such. I just took it to our birthday party and everyone loved it! It was a huge hit! The blue color is my favorite and I know I will get so much use out of this!
Pictures come out too blurry or too light depending on where you are (indoor or outdoor).  I also don't like how awkward it is to handle.
I have been missing my Joycam for many years, so as soon as I saw the Instax Mini, I knew I had to get one. Taking pictures are so much fun even though the film is kind of expensive. Makes a great gift - especially for yourself!
awesome and extremely adorable camera! love the pink color option. highly recommend to anyone interested in an instant camera :)
Came in brand-new, the color is so cute, like a chalky pale yellow. takes the cutest pictures. the settings are quite tricky but i think after using two packs of film, i finally got it.
Got it as a gift from my friend and I LOVE IT! Its super easy to use and prints out great pictures! Its really dummy proof and takes amazing pictures!
I've always wanted an Instax Mini and the price kills!!! <///3 UNTIL I FOUND THIS HOT JACKPOT! It's really worth the price and you'' really have fun with the item, no lie! I'm out of words, awesome gift for my birthday! :3
Works as it should, pics are a bit small but I knew from the beginning so  i'm fine with that.
I really loved it. It's light, easy to use and you can put it in your handbag !. It's perfect as a present, and it's a easy way to make a quick and unforgettable memories.
Purchase N See. I love photography a lot. Captures good pictures.. I wish the film was a bit cheaper. I still like it overall
I bought this camera for my 8 years old daughter as a gift, she loves it! It is easy to use and the pictures are great!
Love it! Cute and light way easy to snap a quick pic of you and your friends or anything else
Such a great little instant camera!  Easy to use, sturdy, and cute to boot.  When I first ordered mine it was defective - the film came out only partially developed as if something was internally blocking it or there was uneven pressure on the rollers, so I just returned the camera.  Sadly I wasted a half a box of film on it (silly me) but strangely enough the first camera came with film already inside of it and my new camera did not...weird right?  I returned it & my new one works great.  Overall I would say do NOT buy at Urban Outfitters, way too overpriced (as everything there is) and customer service here is probably better anyway.  Also be careful not to snap away because film goes quickly - I buy mine in bulk.  Happy instax-ing!
Perfect!!! Great addition to our wedding...wish film was cheaper :/ it was almost as much as the camera when I was done paying though
camera was in perfect condition. worked great my girlfriend loved this gift good for memories in scrap book may be a little big to walk around but good for trips
Very good. Such good quality. Should come with film though. Either way it's a must get camera. Very good camera.
I ordered the Instax Mini 8 a few months ago because I liked the idea of a physical copy in your hand in an instant. I found myself not using it as much as I wanted but I still recommend this camera to anyone who likes photography and wants that vintage look this camera gives. The cameras have a matte finish and I would recommend finding a case and a neck strap. The prices vary, so if they are high, wait awhile and they might go down.
Pros:+ Looks pretty nice+ Was the cheapest, yet most quality among polaroid cameras+ Feels quite sturdy and can probably take a lot of drops+ Compact and can easily be carried around+ Pictures come out quite nice though sometimes blurryCons:- Even though its focused, sometimes it can come out a little blurry- It doesn't come with any film, you have to buy it separately- The counter for packs of film is messed up on mines, it counts 1 more than I actually haveExtra Info:I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it.  Not much else to say about it. 4/5 for the messed up film counter
If ur looking for a cute new modern fujifilm Polaroid this is it!! I see so many pink and white versions. But the yellow one is a great spring and summer color to carry around and snap cute pictures with ur friends or selfies hahaha
Yes the film is costly but it always makes you pause before you capture a moment so you only save your precious memories on print. And there is no better feel than getting the image in hand as soon as you capture it!
Price was right and camera is easy to use. I went onto YouTube to see how to load and use. Nothing tricky about it.Small size print but was perfect to add to album. To center subject move camera to right and down just a bit.
I absolutely love this camera. I thought it was going to be difficult to manage but it was fairly easy. I absolutely love it and so does my friends and family
This camera was so great and lasted through four cartridges while I was in Europe and now it won't work anymore. I put a new cartridge in and it keeps spitting out the film!! I can't get it to stop and I can't find anything about this problem online. No idea what happened. I kept this in the same protective bag as my nikon.
The camera works great and is true to color, but it took me a while to get it too work... I wish that the instructions were clearer, which is ridiculous considering how simple a camera it is.
i love it i received it very fast, takes great pictures only downfall as usual is that the film is quite pricey but overall great camera im happy i bought it!
I love it...not just because pink is my favorite color...it's because it's so cool...I use this camera at first time in Mothers Day Celebration it was fun to use..I really enjoyed it..thank you so much ^_^
I bought this camera on a whim and I love it! Anytime I go somewhere like a theme park, or somewhere special, I take it with me. The instant little pictures are a lot of fun and bring some playfulness to the days. They also fit just right in a smash book compared to regular photos!
Great item would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a cool gift. Check me out the mini film for it
Early b-day giftOrder this product Monday and came in Saturday on standard shippingSuper fast shipping. Highly recommended to all film lovesCamera works fantastic !! No problemsPictures came out beautifullyCan't wait to buy another one for my niece and my sister in law .
I received this a few days after ordering it and it was so cute !!!!! Fast shipping, very fast !!!! Picture quality is pretty good for an instant camera on the go. My little sister loved it, We both love the color, bright yet still pale, just enough pop of color. Thank you !!! Will buy again !
only had it for several days and have only taken 3 pics. the pictures are very clear for as small as they are (but I knew they were credit card size when purchasing camera).  so far I love it.  I think it will be fun for parties, reunions, etc.
i have been looking at this camera for 2 years now, to make sure i didn't buy something that would break the next day. but it is the most wonderful thing! it has a almost toy like appearance, gives good photos, easy to handle, and very portable! i fell in love with film cameras all over again with the first shot i took :)
This will allow me to enjoy instant pics and give them out immediately.  Not like the old instamatic polaroid but it works.
A great little flash back from the retro daysFilm breaks down to almost a dollar a shot, but hey, a picture is worth a thousand words. I recommend YouTubing videos of pros who have used the camera enough to learn all of its little tips/tricks. IE, working with the flash, the frame adjustment.. ect
The purchase of this item brought everyone back to "the old days."  It worked very well and the younger kids at the party (for which we bought the item) were amazed to see the photos magically appear.  We will definitely be using it regularly.  The size of the pictures was fine (I have seen smaller pictures from a similar version).  Purchasing from Amazon was also less expensive than what I had seen at local retailers.
I installed everything I took the first pic and the cover came out, but after that any film came out, what is wrong?
Not much has changed since that old Polaroid I had when I was a kid... I got this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it.  It works the same as the old Polaroid Instant, but the pictures are considerably smaller... probably 1/2 to 2/3's the size... and the film is still expensive.  But she's having fun with it and as long as we don't end up in the poor house buying film, I'd say it was a great little gadget.
I love the camera i had no issue with it, fast delivery ordered it on sunday got it on wednesday (and that was with standard shipping) uhmm i wrote this review on films and id figure that after u buy the camera u deal with the costly issue with films so hear is my review "Sooo, 5 stars i got what i wanted just as is advertised- but heres the better deal, On Amazon! They sell a twin pack (20 films) for 13.40, I being the curious one decided to try out all film packs they r selling and decide what is the best choice. Sooo they sell a 100 pack for 84.50, if u buy the twin pack (5quantities , 100 films) it would only be 67$. Wow. They sell a 40$ pack for 32.95, if u buy 2 twin pack (2quantities, 40 films) it would be 26.80! , they also sell a 50 pack (this item) which cost 36.75, But i found out after purchasing that if u buy 3 twin packs (3quantities, 60! Films) its 40.20, pretty much 3-4 bucks for 10 more films. So yea overall i learned that buying the 13.40 twinpack (20 films) is always the better way to go. (I hope this helped) ! <3 love the product. I also bought a pink case from caiul about 27$ its a good case. Love tht tooo lol anyway!" Hope this helps!
Bought this camera because I wanted to have some fun with my family.  The pictures are small (which I already knew) but SUPER cute!!!  It's solidly built and easy to use.  Plus, it's kind-of old school coming from the digital age!!  Frankly, I purchased this over polaroid because of the reviews- and I'm super happy with it!!  Film is reasonable too- another purchasing factor!  And the colors it comes in are cute for younger people.  Picture quality is great.
My grand-daughter asked for this camera for her 13th birthday.  Since she is of the age that has never had to purchase camera film I question her about that issue and the expense of the film.  Of course at 13 or almost 13 she still wanted the camera.  Since receiving it she has made small scrapbooks of pictures of her friends and seems very happy with the camera.  I have found film makes good gifts for holidays such as Easter etc.Now would I want this camera of course the answer is no, but for a kid, sorry teenager guess it's fun.
Photography is a hobby of mine and this vintage version will be a nice addition.  The credit card size photos are charming and have the look that brings back nostalgic memories.  I have always wanted an instant camera and like that this camera is smaller than others, although the Instax 210 looks cool too.  The pictures I've taken have turned out better than I was expecting and the few available settings seem to work well.  Framing a picture also seems easier than I thought - just keep in mind the viewfinder and lens will capture slightly different views, especially when you are close to your subject.  The flash fires with all pictures taken, so I've read other reviews recommending the use of white electrical tape over the flash to prevent parts of the photo from being too overexposed.
This is so much fun at a get-together!  Instant pictures that are good!  Everyone wants their own copy of the pictures!
This camera is cuter and more fun than it looks or is described on the net.It makes super sharp and colorful prints that are so fun to keep or give away.  It looks adorable and starts conversations at parties.  It is a lot less bulky or heavy than the original Polaroid cameras of old.  Even in this age of digital and cell phone cameras, there is nothing more fun than an instant camera that produces the shot in less than a minute.  Yay!
It's lightweight almost makes the product seem like a joke. But it's ok. it works... but i tried and wasted a couple frames on this camera..This camera cannot take close up photos very well (1ft - 2ft) and the VIEWFINDER IS MISLEADING. My advice: when you press the shutter button, hold your position for another 5 - 10 seconds. the quality of the photos aren't as clear and vibrant as i had hoped. the photos on the advertising is WAY OFF. but it's fun. and still a good idea for scrap booking.
I love it!! Pictures come out perfect & vintage! The only drawback is the amount of film you have to continuously buy. Luckily the film is relatively cheap
Cute, handheld. Remember to always go with their suggested setting for lighting or at least change it because the picture won't turn out well.
I love this camera! It's definitely one of the cutest and best purchases I made. The pictures turn out so nice. Like it's not possible to look bad in one of these pictures lol. The camera came on a Friday and I placed the order on a Monday! On top of that I used free shipping. Oh and btw it does not come with film. That's something I wondered when ordering it but I purchased my own separately. But overall I am in love and I can't wait to start capturing more memories with this camera.
Used this for a party and everyone loved it.  It's been so long the older generations has long forgotten about it and the younger generations are fascinated by having a photo printed right then and there.
This Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera (Blue) is so cute, I bought it for a party photo booth and the pics taken were sharp and the colors were  bright.
Used camera at party in a photo booth and everyone loved the instant view of photos. Very Happy with outcome.
It was a blast using and giving photos to friends but it broke the third time using it. The camera would turn on and then continually snap photos and waste a whole cartridge of expensive film.  It was to late to return it, nothing on the internet to trouble shoot my problem, and no one to talk to get a new camera or my money back.
My daughter wanted one for her birthday even though I told her that it was not worth it when she has an IPhone and a digital camera.  But, she wanted one anyway.  This is not like the polaroids we used to have back in the day.  It's made of cheap plastic and takes little pictures with the expensive film.  The pictures are not even full size pictures.  So, in my opinion, it's a waste of money.
I got this for my upcoming wedding and took a test shot of my kitty.  It's going to be perfect for my guest book!
Can't seem to get the correct lighting desired in any of my photos, but I love that it is instant and the photos are cute. Wish there were more "light leak" type coloring in the prints instead of just a regular "overexposed" or underexposed which are typically just black to white. Do wish they were a LITTLE bigger, and though there is a bigger fujifilm instax camera, I already find this one is pretty large. The other camera is a little crazy in size and pretty impractical for me.
the color is what i expected and it is really really cute!! just waiting for the films to come and i will try it out
While digital photos are great there's something about having physical prints to hold onto.  It's a wonderful experience to go through shoe boxes of photos with friends and family.  Being able to create those pictures with an instant camera and your kids dds to the fun (and silliness).When Polaroid went the way of the dinosaur I was worried that we wouldn't ever have an instant camera to use as our boys grew up.  This camera filled void and has been great.FunEasy to useNice quality picturesI have recommended this camera to all of my friends with kids and those who have gotten it love it as much as we do.
Good service!
This is a terrific camera.  Well made.  Takes fairly good pictures for what it is.  These little mini pics are adorable.
i purchased this camera purely based on the reviews without much thought to the utility.however, it turned out to be a great product. I used it when I met my friends and they liked it a lot.my friends got excited and kept all the snaps as souvenirs and they planned to buy the same cameraThe camera works favorably in all the conditions, care to be taken for the light.Works great in the sun light and even in the dusk. During nights, ensure there is full light all over.All-in-all its worthy and you can have some good nice important memories :)
Great little camera for new school polaroid. Took on a cruise when we first got it and works perfect for what we got it for.
I really like this camera! it is so cute and the quality of the pictures is great! I'm glad I purchased it!
I am so excited to receive my fabulous camera!! Not only is it much cheaper then it is at urban outfitters but it's an awesome camera to have!! All my friends love them! I can't wait to receive my white camera!I ordered this yesterday so my shipment is still being processed but this company is awesome to order from I accidentally ordered two of them instead of one (whoops) and they were so quick in responding to me and canceling one of the cameras for me, they were extremely helpful and very nice! I would definitely order this camera and from this company as well!
It's everything it says it is. It's really good and the pictures are so cute, they look really old fashioned.
Got this as a gift for my younger cousin & she absolutely loves it! Would recommend it to anyone that wants a camera without all that extra weight. Was expecting it to be really tiny, but thank goodness it isn't. Suits her very well for a petite girl. A must buy if you don't want to have a bulky camera.
I freaking LOVE this camera. I use it when I go to parties and all my friends love it and want one now. It's super simple to use.
This Fuji mini polaroid is so adorable.  It takes me back in time when polaroid's were popular.  It's easy to use and the pictures are a mini version of what we were used to.
I love how affordable this camera is and how good it is with its job.I took a couple of pictures with it and I love the sentimental value attached to every special picture captured. It's a more different experience compared to just taking loads of snapshots with your phone, not filtering out really what are the best moments.So far, it feels durable. I'll have to have the camera for a couple months to really tell. But thankfull I have the mini zippered case for the instax.Oh by the way, DON'T FORGET TO ADJUST THE SLIDER! I mistakenly forgot to do  that and my picture was washed out!
I'm so glad I got this Camera it's so cute I got the blue one and I use it all the time. I got a clear case so I can still see the past blue color. It takes great outdoors photos just remember to change it to sunny or cloudy.  Very easy to take photos it's basic stuff turn on off and snap button. Very light not heavy I have a strap that go around my neck. It comes with a cute strap the color of the camera.
I'm using these camera for guests at my wedding to snap photos for my quest book and to keep for themselves. Also, after using I can see myself snapping these photos at every family get together or party. It's really fun to use and the photos came out great. Way more than i expected.
I love this camera! It's so easy & fun to use. My only complaint is the cost of the film but other than that the pictures are amazing quality for this little thing. I can't wait to take it on vacation with me! Definitely a must have for any teenager even adults trust me you will love it.
Arrived on time and works like a charm. It's so cute and the perfect camera to carry around with you. My first Polaroid came out looking great and had very good quality.
My best friend has a pink one. We take photos a lot and I love it. The camera looks cute in pink.
my sons were amazed at the pictures that came out right away, and quality on the credit card sized photo paper was excellent!
Great little camera! So much fun to play with! Wish there was a timer on it though. Besides that awesome!
So excited i ordered this! Absolutely no regrets! Loving every moments with this camera! My sister wants one and can not wait to get her one.
this camera is durable, cute, fun, easy to use, and a great way to keep memories. whenever i bring it out at get-togethers its always a big hit and everyone wants a picture. i do recommend watching youtube tutorials on how to work the camera so you wont waste as much film. dont forget to set it to the right setting before taking a picture! i've been having lots of fun with this device. the only con is that no stores sell it around me besides urban outfitters (which is expensive) so i have to buy it online, but whenever im down to my last pack i know to buy another one. this is such a great deal and im glad i didnt settle for any other price. if youre trying to find the best price for this camera, buy it here. you wont find a better deal!
This camera is great. I was looking into the instax for awhile just never actually bought one so I'm very glad I went ahead and picked one up
i love my camera it is so cute and handy ! the pink is gorgeous! i would recomment ot every girl who loves pink!
Fits perfectly and matches the Fuji camera just fine. The colrs are a perfect match as well. Provides good protection
Everyone should own one at some point in their lives. I like unplanned photographs and cameras that make sounds. Imperfection is more fun to look at.
It's very useful for me. I can use it to record the beautiful memories. It's really good! Awesome! Excellent! U can buy it now!
I was hesitant to buy this camera, as I was a kid the last time instant film cameras were popular. They didn't take great pictures, and the film was expensive. I'm a camera junkie though, so I didn't want to miss out on trying it.As the mom of a toddler, I figured taking pictures of her with it was out of the question. I was totally wrong. This camera takes pictures very quickly, and we haven't had a blurry one yet. Plus, she is mesmerized by seeing the picture come out of the camera. I can't wait until she is a little older, and can take some pictures with it herself.In an age of photos that live on hard drives, there is just something so fun about having your picture instantly. We've already created a board to hand them on, and I love looking at it and seeing the pictures we've taken each day.
It was really nice and exactly the way I expected it to be since I watched a bunch of reviews on YouTube and read a lot of reviews before buying this camera. Batteries are included which is a plus. The strap is a decent length, but most of the time when I use my camera, I don't use the strap. The camera is really nice and everything was perfect.
By far the Best purchase I've made in a while!:) I love love love love this camera! I take it every where and capture cute moments of my everyday life to remember :)
It is a gift for my friend. But my friend told me that she didn't receive it. Sorry it was long time to repl, because I just knew it.
Received it right on time.  Have only used it to take 3 pictures so far.  Saving for a wedding in May.
I originally bought this camera for my self but my sister in laws birthday came up and I decided to give it to her she loves it and I decided to get my self a white one.these cameras are great for family or friend eventsto capture all the great momentyou wont regret buying this!
I had a Polaroid when I was younger, but now that they don't sell film for it, it is very expensive. So I found this and the film is very affordable! Love the color and just love the product itself.
I love this camera! Despite it being around 67 dollars at the time of purchase, I bought this on impulse. However, I do not regret it. I love this camera and it has quickly become a favorite item. I bought this camera on April 3rd, and received it two days later on April 5th around evening using Amazon Prime, FedEx shipping. It came right on time for the event I was hoping to use it for! Now, I wish that there was a timer on it, or that flash was optional, but otherwise it's fine. The fact it's so cute is another plus! The pictures literally are the size of a credit card, I compared it myself! Make sure you are wary of lighting, flash is automatic, and if it's really cloudy outside, the pictures may or may not look right, although the mood does adjust based on lighting. Be careful of what you take pictures of, because pictures print instantly and you don't want to waste film, which can be expensive (usually 11-30 dollar range). This camera can only hold 10  photos at a time, which is why most packs come in packs of 10, but some packs come so you buy 20 or more, usually at a higher price but may be worth it if you don't want to keep buying more film each time you finish 10. Despite it's cute, almost toylike appearance, I wouldn't give this camera to a child. At least not to a non responsible one. The camera isn't really small so it's not something you can stash in a pocket and go, but it will fit nice in a decent sized purse, or in a backpack. I recommend this camera very much!
Wonderful quality, easy to use and a very pretty color. Nothing unexpected or unwanted. Came as expected, a great purchase!
Works perfect indoors or in very shaded areas but if you try and take pictures outside while it is sunny the pictures do no develop correctly. Only the darks in the picture would show up and everything else would be white.
I really like this little cute camera! I brought this camera for my best friend's birthday present and she love it so much! The product came on time and the quality is pretty good. I recommend this product.
Fujifilm Instax Mini was everything I was expecting and more, absolutely love this camera. I would definitely recommend buying this!
Amazing. Takes great pictures! It has lots of settings to play with. Comes out instantly. Only thing is it doesn't come with film.
i wanted the pink one because it just reminds me of a camera i saw my cousin have. its just cute and the pastel pink is what i was looking for. i purchased this for nostalgic reasons. completely happy with it but film costs a lot.
This camera is easy and fun for the family.  It's just like the old camera when I was a kid.  Point, shoot the picture and out comes the film and develops right before your eyes! The camera appears to be well built, time will tell.I would recommend this for the kids!
It's a pretty neat camera! Was exactly what I expected. The only bad thing I have it say is that the camera takes pictures slightly to the right which does get annoying because sometimes you can't take the pic you wanted, it just takes a few times to get used to it and after that you should be fine.
Pretty handy camera to have. 👌 Perfect for wallet pics to carry around fun or cute pics with you too.
For paying $70 for this really cool looking camera, I thought the quality of the photos would be a little nicer.
this is perfect.  doesnt look as cool as the other one, but perfect easy to use and no problem with it at all. worth getting on amazon with the discount since everywhere else is full price.  its  atad chunky and looking through the viewfinder can be tough (esp drunk)
Good product bought it as a gift lets see what happens after a few uses see I'd it holds up
I love it! Super cute and the photos come out great. I just wish the film wasn't so expensive. Almost feels like a toy and it might break but it's been working fine for the past few months.
I bought this as one of my fiancee's gifts this last Christmas and she just loves it. It's awkwardly large compared to your modern cameras, but the pictures it delivers are retro and fun for projects. Every time we use it someone mentions how they love it and they need one right away. People are always asking us to take a photo of them.
It is a party hit every time!  Worth it just to get instant photos to be able to give to friends
The camera arrived well on time in exactly the color as shown on the pictures. Camera difficult to find in this color elsewhere at a reasonable price.
Bought this camera for our PTA to  use at events and it has been a huge hit!  Kids are amazed.  Camera works great.  Very simple.
I never thought this camera was going to be the success it is with my children. They are enjoying it. Perfect condition and perfect transaction. Highly recommended vendor!
This camera is so much fun! We bought it for our kids to take on a trip for scrapbooking along the way. It was so perfect for instant pictures for them to see and be able to put in their books right away. Fantastic!!!
Not only does this have an air of nostalgia, I just love the pastel yellow color I got which also seems retro, and it's fun to take to events and the photo's turn out well.
I love it! Its amazing!!! Fun to have around for special occasions and especially for trips! Definitely worth your money!
Very good câmera is the best!!!!! Love much, I want to buy more colors.... Is fast and fun. J'adore :)
This camera is great for gatherings!I can't go anywhere without it.It is so fun and easy to use.
This was a birthday gift for our high school son and he loves it. It takes great pictures and is easy to operate.
I love my camera so much! I get many complements too, but i don't like to buy the films too pricy. );
Did not have to wait a long time before I received it, brand new as described, great product! Looking forward to more adventures with this baby.
Purchased this camera because a friend had one and pulled it out one day at a social function and starting taking pics of us and others, but than gave us our printed picture right at that moment! Updated version Fujifilm has come up with of the old polaroid. Whenever I am out taking pictures most people love that I can hand them their picture right there.
people often forget what kind of camera they are buying when they purchase this - it DOES require the instax instant film, so don't forget to buy a pack or two when ordering! i had originally wanted the pink version, but it was easily twenty dollars more. i'm glad i got the white as it's much more classic and i know i won't be as obsessed with keeping it spotless.this camera is absolutely adorable! it's very easy to use and you won't even need instructions to set it up as it's pretty self explanatory. it tells you what setting to put it in and everything, very simple. the film develops in a few minutes. i knew exactly what i was getting myself in to with this camera and for that reason i am very happy with my purchase!
I would surely recommend this product to others. Its a great Camera that takes clear photos. There is a light that tells you what setting to use before taking a quick snap of your subject. The pictures are a great size, im glad i started scrap booking again. The only thing is, there is no actual zoom, so you do hat=ve to be close to your subject. Other than that, its pretty awesome.
I love this camera. I wanted the pink one but the white one was considerably cheaper until after I bought it, then the pink one was cheaper.
Great product got here on time and my gf loved it as a birthday present. If your looking for a reliable instant camera this is it!
If you loved classic polaroid photos this is your dream instant photo camera! I love it so much, I get to snap super cute pics of my son and get them instantly in my hand to put up!
I bought this for my cousin on her 12th birthday so she could instantly capture and print memories with her friends. She's loved the gift -- there are lots of different instax film packs you can buy for it (Mickey Mouse, for example) and even little frames and albums that are the perfect size for the prints. Great gift.
It was kind of bulky to use and I couldn't get good pictures. Pictures either too light or too dark and some pictures with 3 people ,one would come out white faced.
This camera was exactly what I hoped for. It came on time and it was exactly what was advertised. Couldn't be happier with the product.
This camera works great! It's a bit larger than I thought it would be, but is easy to hold, point + shoot.I have yet to use it in natural light, but the flash does a good job of illuminating dark or indoor photos.I don't have any complaints.
I use it when I hang out with friends/family, and everyone loves it. It makes me happy that I can give a picture to other people right away, and see how happy they are. It might not work that well when the light is not perfect, there is a light to indicate which mode to use basing on light, but sometimes it changes too frequently I can't seem to make the best choice. I might just need to be more patient at this. Overall, I love it!
I purchased this camera for my 14 year old granddaughter for her birthday.  She loves it.  Easy to use and pictures come out just as expected.
You have to be careful I repeat HAVE TO BE CAREFUL with the sun You can easily waste film if its too bright even if you adjust the dial the photo will end up white . Also DO NOT open the back where the film goes it will completely mess up the order of film you have left I was very curious as to what happens if I opened it and messed up the order I had 4 pictures left and the dial said 8 ! Very frustrating. Over all very great camera :)
This camera is perfect. The color is very kawaii and the pictures are easy and fun to take. Absolute perfection!
I bought it for my daughter's birthday. She is having a lot of fun with the camera. That's all I have to say!
I was disappointed because I thought the pictures would be bigger and brighter. The best pictures must be close up ones.But, as I`ve always wanted an instant camera, I`ll go on trying to learn how to use it properly.
Definitely suited my purposes of having photos in hand whenever I want to send one to a friend. I wish the flash wasn't more controllable and the instructions were more clear.Otherwise it's a good camera.
I bought this little gem along with a scrapbook, multipack film, glue sticks and a set of multicolored, fine tip sharpies.  It was the prefect combo for my 40th birthday party.  The camera was such a hit and everyone was so excited to see a throwback form the good 'ol days.  The pictures are small which is perfect for my 12x12 scrapbook.  One problem I had was I had to reel people in when they yelled "doover!"  No, no, no...the film is not cheap and it's not a smartphone.  Funny how times have changed.  Great fun for the price....you won't regret it.
It was packaged so nicely!When i got it, it was smaller than i had expected, but it was still really cute. I love this camera so much.
Used this as well as a 7S at my moms 60th birthday party to add pictures to a scrap book.  People loved it and were taking pictures all night!  Will also use it for the guest book at my wedding in 3 months.
I had wanted one of these cameras for ages and was thrilled when I saw how cheap they are now, so I went for the light blue camera. The camera arrived in pristine condition with a really cute box. It also came with a camera strap (with strap holes on both sides of the camera) and two AA batteries. The camera does not come with film (you have to buy that seperately, the twin packs run at about 13 bucks for 20 exposures) but the camera is very aesthetically pleasing and makes it fun and easy to take pictures. It produces credit-card sized photos that are super cute and fun to carry around. If you're looking for a camera that produces larger photos you might wanna go for an Instax Wide instead but this is a really fun camera and I'm very glad I finally bought one. Would definitely reccomend!
Takes suprisingly great pictures. Is extremely compact and super freaking cute. The film Is a little expensive but is well worth it. All around great buy.
I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this camera, and I was mot disappointed. It came well packed, as pictured/described, and delivered ahead of schedule. I only wish my film would have came the same day, so I could start snapping away immediately.
I really wanted to get a Polaroid instant camera but it (and the film) were quite expensive. This is the same, if not better. The color is a light rose pink and is very cute. Unlike Polaroid, its newer. I like that because it gives that vintage look, but with a modern device. The film is more of a rectangle but I personally like it better. I had to take some time to get use to it, but I am very happy that I got it. Be very careful with shots that are close up. Its better to be a few feet away from something because it can get blurry when too close. Also I took a picture of the sun and it made it black. Prior to purchasing this, I didn't know much about instant camera with film, but be careful with too much light. Instead it will just make it black. Other than those two adjustments, its a really good product and I haven't had much difficulty with it. Very pleased!
I totally love this camera! It is great for sweet moments you want to capture. Worth $70 for sure. Great buy
Love it!!!! Little expensive for film but totally worth it, takes awesome pictures. I would recommend this to anyone any age.
Seriously this is a bad ass camera, I love it.. Its funny and easy to use, just got to get  used to adjusting light settings but I've gone through almost 70 film and just about everyone of them are perfect. Love love love.. And the seller is great, trustworthy and friendly would defiantly buy from again..
There's nothing quite like taking a shot and a little picture coming out of the top of this camera. It's so much fun!My favorite thing about this camera, besides the design & color (I got blue), is the fact that I am choosing my shots carefully. Unlike with a digital camera, you'll want to be selective about which moments you choose to capture since it's not like you can click away endlessly. This adds charm to it, for me anyways.This camera can really capture the moment in a beautiful way. You just have to play with the exposure at first to get the feel for the best shots. Also, don't shoot too close to your subject or it/they will be blurry. It's fun to play around with it aside from the film being a bit too expensive to waste for test shots.Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for an instant camera.
I obsessed with my new camera. I almost bought the Fujifilm Instax Wide camera because it was cheaper, and the pictures would be larger. I finally decided to go with the Instax mini because I realized I'd a save a little on film, and didn't like the bulkiness of the Instax wide. I also love all the different film designs that are for the mini. The pictures for the mini are actually a nice as well. Like everyone says they are the size of a credit card but you can still capture a lot in the picture which is what I love. Overall I am happy with it.
Color has been enhanced since the days of the Polaroid Pronto, Great Product and will keep using it, keep the price low!
This camera is totally cute. Very easy to use, just make sure to follow all instructions.  This camera is perfect for all kind of parties.  Instant memories!
OK so i got this for Christmas and it takes the best photots in the world like i love it and all my friends are so jealous and want one now i totally recommend it!!!!!
It was great! The color of the camera was nice. Other than the blurry lightning at times, the camera is great.
I bought his with credit from amazon so ended paying just 30$ For it. It takes amazing photos! I wasted just like two practicing. Everything is perfect of it. Took it to Mexico City for a baptism ;) everyone loved it!
This is a great little camera we have had so much fun with it already. I purchased for a diy photo booth for my daughters wedding and we have been playing with it. The kids love to watch the film pop up and then watch the picture develop.
Cute, fun, Polariod-like camera.  My wife used it to take pictures and create a collage while still on vacation.  We still need practice to determine the right light setting.  So far the pictures have been a mix of too light, too dark, and just right.  Hopefully we get better!
My daughter bought this camera for a friend's birthday. Her friend loved it. I got to se it yesterday to take a picture. Point , click and out pops the picture. the quality of the picture was good.
This camera is adorable!  The old school polaroids just got cooler!  Bought this for my niece for her birthday and she is creating  an art collage with all the cool photos she's taking!  Recommend this for young and old!  it's an inexpensive way to create unique art!
I'm sending it back.  I really would so like having this kind of camera, but clearly it is't ready for prime time.  Sadly, the pictures are very unsatisfactory.  If I were Fujifilm, I would be embarrassed beyond belief.  Polaroid pictures from back-in-the day were far superior. Right there you can see the problem.
This is the year 2014, everything is digital.  I live in NYC.  I absolutely love this camera.  it is so much fun.  Tourists and locals all are amazed that I have it and want one.  People love taking pictures of us with it wherever we go and it is so much fun.  Everyone always asks me where I got it.  Digital is one thing but we all have that and use it, and over use it.... but something you can touch and feel and put in your wallet is really unique these days.  Our fridge is covered with these pictures and everyone who comes over asks where I got this camera.  I never write reviews, but this is one I felt compelled to write.  My sister and I are going on a seven day cruise through the Southern Caribbean, I bought 11 packs of film for the trip :)
This is a durable camera. I've dropped this thing multiple times and it shoots pictures just as well as the first time I used it.
This camera is FANTASTIC! It's an updated throwback to the Polaroid! It turns on quickly, no waiting and the settings are easy too. It's a little bulky but if you wanted something lesser so, just take pics with your smartphone. This is a toy and a conversation piece and will bring many people's memories back to the Polaroid days.
I love this camera! its small and portable, and has good quality photos.  Its a good price for something like this.  I recommend this for anyone!
I bought this for my daughter.  It was easy to use and she love it.  I choose this over the polaroid and I am glad I did.
I bought this for my younger 17 year old sister for Christmas.  She absolutly loves it and all her friends really liked it to.  She used it on NYE and got a lot of great pictures.  I also have one but the larger one, and I love mine!  Great product, would recommend.
it is a little too pricey and so are the films but i have little kids and its easier to keep track with memories! :) love the item!!
I bought this camera for my personal enjoyment. I love it and so does all my friends. Instant pics that are clear. Definitely fun to have around. Nostalgia from my childhood.
OH. MY. GOSH. The camera was beautiful, small, and adorable. It was easy to use, came SUPER SUPER FAST and well packaged, came with instructions AND a cute little matching blue string so I could wear it around my neck. The pictures came out flawless, clear, and cute. I taped them up on my wall. The pictures were focused and I cannot get over how cute the whole thing is, and kids can use it. So, if you're debating whether to get this or not, I totally totally reccomend it. It was EXACTLY what I was looking for, even more, and prettier, cuter, (sorry for the overuse of the word cute, it's just so CUTE!) and easier than a typical Polaroid. It's my favorite thing EVER, even though the flash might hurt you or your pets eyes.
Absolutely love this camera! I really wish the film wasn't so expensive and that it would come with a pack, but I love the different flash options you can use and the film quality is great!
It's a really nice camera, it came in fast and is very easy to use. The film is expensive but I really enjoy the quality I the photos.
great camera!!! I love using it!! warning thought if you take a direct pictur of the sun as in a sunset or sunrise  you will get a little blue dot in the middle so you guys don't think it's defective. other than that I love it! be careful not to take pictures in a lot of a lot of sunlight because it may turn out white but you just have to play around with it OH AND BUY FILM BC IT DOESNT COME WITH IT
This camera was amazing! It came to be half the price it is on urban outfitters  and in mint condition! I can't stop using this camera, it's perfect!
The product was very good, however the size of the film are much smaller than they seem, i was a little disappointed but in the end, there was no malfunctions and it was in a great condition.
I gave it as a gift and it was one of the best things I could have done. It's exactly what they wanted.
I love my camera! It shipped very quickly and on time.It's super cute, comes with simple instructions and comes with a wrist strap.It takes good photos except in poor lighted areas but it's a Polaroid so that's kind of what I expected.The film/ size of the picture it spits out is about the size of a business card. It's really cute and great for journaling or scrap booking.I had very reasonable expectations for this camera and it is honestly just a lot of fun.Seems to be very durable.Takes two double A batteries (If I remember right) and they actually provide them to you within the box.Very good product.
This was a really good gift for my teenage daughter.  She uses it a lot. The film is a little high but you can find some deals on multi packs.  I love that the camera came in colors.  Im sure her and her friends will enjoy this a lot..
Used this at the sign in table for my wedding.  Instead of a book, I had my greeters take pictures of the guests to display on a photo board.  Was a huge hit.  The camera was also a huge hit!!  Love the business size photo cards.  Great quality for such a small instant camera.
Camera was well-packaged and came with everything described. Note that the camera doesn't come with film so you have to buy film packs separately.Unfortunately, I am left-eye dominant, so looking through the viewfinder is a little silly compared to cameras with the viewfinder centered.Overall, satisfied with this except that it arrived two days later than expected, and shipping information didn't update during those two days.
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year-old granddaughter.  It was a favorite.  Film is a bit pricey, but well worth it for the enjoyment of instant printed photos.
I love this camera. It is so cute and lightweight intake it everywhere! The pictures look vintage and mostly clear, it's great!
I use this at most parties and people are interested in it. It great to hang the photos on the wall or put the photos in your wallet.
As a lover of the past brings back many memories using this type of technology because by keeping it on the market
Bought this camera for my daughter. She really likes it. I was having a difficult time finding this camera at stores, so I finally tried the internet. It was delivered within the time promised.
It's so cute and love the light blue color! It's a bit more lightweight than the original Instax camera that I have and I think the functions are awesome. Auto detection for lighting is so much better than the original camera because you can't gauge how dark or light some pictures will come out based on where you are inside or outside. Love that it's not as clunky! Definite great buy. Just wished that it didn't feel so cheap, the plastic kind of feels like if you dropped the camera it would just fall apart.
It was as described, very compact, easily portable, and very cute! I got it as a gift for my sister and she loves it. Takes great pictures.
It is very nice look. Good quality I have ever seen. It is a very good gift choice. I like it.
loved it! very and on time just like it was advertised - does what its supposed to so im happy
Well I'm not expecting any further function on this camera other than instant photo. It works great and got to make sure you switch to the right mode where you are picturing (indoor, outside, etc).
We purchased this camera for our daughter & as parents remember the old Polaroid instant pictures. This is camera is more advanced as it has modes to adjust for the lighting & the pictures come out on top in the size of a credit card. The film can be purchased here on Amazon but have recently began to see them at local Wal-Mart's. If you have a teenage daughter then I'm sure they'll love this gift for years to come.
I love this camera, its so cute ! and the pictures come out great ! So happy with this item!
This came earlier than expected! I recently purchased this because i felt like these are my teen years and that i'd love to reflect and look back on these pictures when I'm older. the camera is the perfect size and is adorable. it's amazingly fun and all of my family members and friends keep asking to get their picture taken to be added to my scrapbook. this is great if you want to catch some of your memories over the years without having to go and get them printed. I'm already recommending this to all my friends and this is a perfect gift for a teen or someone who is into photography.
quality camera with all the charm film brings but with a modern look and functionality. came new with packing and very speedy shipping. I would definitely recommend this item.
My 9 year old daughter received this for her birthday. She loves it! The pictures turn out clear. She also got the sticker pack to decorate the frame of each picture. The polka dot camera case is great for her to carry it around and take pictures without taking the camera out. I love it!
In love with this mini instant camera!! Extremely easy to use, the photos are adorable and the price can't be beat.
Bought my daughter this camera. And her and her friends just loves it. Very light and easy to take around with them. Pictures come out well. And she loves the deco film we can order for it as well.
I love this camera.  The reason I wanted one was because I missed using Polaroids and I used them growing up as a kid.I love the functionality and the pretty colors that it comes in.I am very happy with the quality that Fujifilm has for their products, and am excited to buy film with different designs upon them all!
Love this little camera. It is lots of fun. U pay a little more for film but its worth it. Everywhere u take it is a big hit.
The idea of these little Poloroid cameras is wonderful.  Small little photos pop out instantly, making you the hit of any party, but the Instax Mini 8 just didn't cut the mustered. All the photos came out blurry, washed out or too dark.  So we returned this and exchanged it for the Instax Mini 50S.  It's not worlds better, but it's definitely the better of the two.These cameras are a great deal of fun, but my advice; skip the Mini 8 and get the 50S instead.
This is perfect, try not to use it in light backgrounds but i've gotten some really good candids of my friends and family. It took really cool pictures of my plants and the snow outside. I love it!
Really happy with the purchase, was exactly what I was expecting.  With the actual specs of the camera, it's kind of annoying that flash can't be turned off, so I've covered it in black electrical tape, but that's about it.  Really nice camera to have when trying to take quick pictures and have 'instant gratification' with the physical photo in your hand.  I would really recommend this for someone who wants a good instant camera, but isn't willing to pay the 40+ dollars for polaroid film and/or a 100 dollar camera.
It is so cute! The product itself is adorable! And The picture filmed by it is very clear, love it!
The camera is fun to use and easy to travel with. With the small size I can throw the camera in my purse and I'm ready to go! This would also make a great gift for someone!
I got the pink color and it is so cute! Easy to use, great for travel. I will actually use this for my wedding guestbook/photobook! I bought it with Fujifilm Instax Mini Instant Film, 10 Sheets (5-Pack).
This is such a fun camera.  It brings back memories of the old polaroids!  The picture quality is very similar to the old polaroids as well, so don't expect "today's digital camera" quality :)  I debated between these small prints and the larger ones, but with the cost of the film, figured I'd stick to the tiny pics.  Film is too expensive to waste, so I only break out this camera on certain occasions!  Just a lot of fun, and all my friends get a good laugh when they try it out (at least those that are old enough to remember the other instant cameras)!
Dinner with the family and the Instax was the only thing she asked for on her 16th birthday. She loves it!
Very cute small camera, portable and instant. Took a lot picture with it, but be careful not to expose too much sunlight when waiting for the film. Otherwise the picture will be totally white
My guilty pleasure. I love this tiny little thing! I honestly think I have better pictures with this camera than our dslr. We choose film that has the normal background edges or the ones with different colors, or characters. It's wonderful!I purchased the case with it an it works great too. It's nice when you're out and about, take photos and are able to put them on the side compartment until you can store them somewhere else. I'm extremely happy with this purchase.
This camera produces great quality prints, and it's so fun to use! The different light settings easily capture proper lighting for different settings.
This camera is very good! And the shipment is very good too. It's very fast. And this camera is soooo cute!I love it!
This is the coolest camera ever! If you like old school polaroid cameras then this is a classy, fun way to go.  The pink color is cute and retro and it comes with some film. I love it!
I bought this for my young daughter because she is always taking pictures with my digital camera and never gets to do anything with the results (I'm one of those people who's pictures pretty much sit on the computer). I also thought it would help her take more clear pictures because she would see the results right away.She loves it, and I've had tons of fun with it as well. She has her own little journal that is enhanced with photos (of Christmas, vacations, etc). Will definitely need to order more film!Bottom line- the camera works like you would expect (if you've ever seen an instant film camera and the resulting picture) and everyone wants to use it or have their photo taken. I spent way too long comparing the different cameras, now I see it just doesn't matter! Photos look exactly like they did on my old mini Polaroid I had 15 years ago, and on the full size Polaroid my parents had before that. I chose the Fuji brand because I liked the color and shape (thought my daughter would), the price, size and price of film, but I don't think the various models really make a difference.
If your looking for a Polaroid camera well by this one. You can chose the colors you want by blue,pink,yellow,black and white and very good quality picture.
this is a great little camera. got it for my daughter for Christmas present. and she just loved it.  its amazing you actually get pictures in your hand. better than digital!! just like the old days! I want one!!
Camera is a great price and the film is a bit expensive but the sentimental value is worth it :)
This is an awesome camera to bring to the party. Many people at the party didn't know what this is and how it worked. I guess technology does move fast. haha But really wonderful machine and it's really fun to use it with friends.
Works wonderfully. The next best thing to a Polaroid 600. Works fast. Great color! Wonderful. I would love to try the bigger version.
My pink instax mini is my first camera and i wanted it to be retro. It is  a convocation starter exciting people who thought that these cameras where extinct and easy way to take pictures and keep them as memoirs. Great for scrap booking or for the start of enjoying photography.
I got this camera so I could take quick fast pictures of my new puppy. It does pretty well with taking inside pictures but outside pictures can be iffy. I took two pictures of my puppy in snow and on them both the whole picture looks like it is still waiting to fully develop. Overall though it is a great camera and I am really happy with this purchase.
This camera is sooo cool! Brings back memories of the 80's when I had an Polaroid instant camera. The only down side is the cost of the film.
my wife wanted this camera for a long time im glad you guys had it for a great price thanks
I bought this product for my sister who really wanted a Polaroid camera for Christmas.The packaging was secured and the item was clean and very good to use.I gave 4 stars because it was not really for me and I never used it but overall, she seems to be satisfied and it came on time!
I love the camera. Gives me everything I expected and wanted. No regrets at all. Very light weight and great for traveling. Just used it to test it out and it was amazing. Great for memories and events! would love to recommend to others about this amazing camera. Would make people jealous and envious about how cool this instant camera is! love love!
It's a great and affordable camera that gives you that fantastic nostalgic feeling! Very easy to use and the photos turn out great! Hipsters would definitely approve. If I had a time machine, I'd go back in time and buy this again and again.
Fun and an easy camera to use.  The pictures can be a little small though so be prepared for small visuals.
My step daughter absolutely loved it. She got it for Christmas and she has been enjoying it with friends and family.
My daughter got this camera at Christmas and we have found it works very well. It does exactly what it is designed to do - produce instant pictures. But if you are looking for high resolution portrait type quality, this is not designed to do that. It gives you nice little pictures to give to others on the spot.
I wish there was an instant camera available that took bigger pictures, otherwise the camera works well and the prints are good quality
My daughter loves this camera.It works great and is great for a kids scrapbook.The pictures are good quality for being so small.
This camera was exactly what I was looking for. Shipping was fast. It's a great value for the money. Would buy again.
I love how it's really lightweight, pretty, and easy to handle. All you have to do is load the film, look in the viewfinder, and press the button! The only thing that bothered me was the parallax of the viewfinder, but thats for almost every type of camera. It can get scratched easily, but the texture of it is nice. It's also convenient that it came with batteries to get you started, and a strap to protect it from accidentally falling out of your hand haha. It's also a good price (I got it for 70 with free shipping) for such a nice camera that is the upgraded version of the 7s! :)
This is a fantastic little instant camera.  The design is fun and modern.  The pics, while -very small, come out pretty crisp and clear.  While instant film cameras will never replace digital or even traditional film cameras, if you're looking for something fun and something that can sate your need for "instant gratification", I would go with this camera.
I ordered this camera to use at my wedding for people to include pics when they signed the guestbook.  It is perfect.
Got this for my nephew for Christmas this year. I thought he'd like it, but I didn't know just how much he would love it. He called to tell me it is his favorite Christmas gift, and then he went on to explain all of the features/everything he's taken a photo of so far. He takes it with him everywhere. Glad I got it for him!
this camera is an amazing throwback product of the 80's that adds wonder to the art of photography. somehow the thrill has returned to taking pictures and having a tangible "actual photograph" to give to a friend to remember you by. this was a gift for my wife and it has made her so happy that precious memories are no longer at constant risk of ending up on the internet but will remain with you privately. the quality of the pictures are amazing inspite of the small size of the film. we took photos in broad daylight and the pictures came out crisp and clear. the time it takes for the film to develop was fast but just enough to cause some suspense. the size of the film is perfect for a shirt pocket so shoot away!
Works as well as described and is easy to use, pictures have great color and sharpness! Love the look of the retro photos!
Ordered for my daughter's birthday.  Paid more so it would be there in time.  Week after birthday, still no camera!
We have had so much fun with this camera.  Be forewarned, the pictures are smaller than the polaroids of the 70's, but they are fun to take.  Using it for a project in room décor, hanging the pictures along a hanging wire on the wall, really cute.
The camera is cute and the kids get a kick out of it....but the picture is very small and you need to get quite a bit closer thatn you would generally need to in order to get the close up picture that you wanted.The film is also expensive....this is more just a novelty gift as opposed to a functional camera.....but it's fun!
I had low expectations for this camera, and boy, was I pleasantly surprised! Camera takes excellent close to mid range shots. So far, I haven't taken that many shots (because of the price of the film, around a $1 per photo), but most of them have turned out excellent. I have received many compliments on the quality of the photo and its uniqueness. I only wish the it had optional flash; the flash is always used on every photo. It's my new go to camera for parties, and it's great to share an actual photo with friends and family. If you are looking to spend a little bit more money, I would recommend and looking at the newer, more stylish and more featured Fujifilm Instax camera, but for those who are looking to replicate the older Polaroid cameras, this is a great buy!
Great quality with less expense and fast delivery. I'll definitely recommend this product. I bought for my sister and she just loves it!
Great! Shipped super lightning fast. My wife loves her new gift. It's great. We get to have these little keepsake instant pictures of our kids.
The pictures are smaller than I thought they would be they are clear.  I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others
It has a great look, and takes good quality pictures.This is really good to have if you're making a scrapbook, collage, etc.
exactly what we hoped for when we got it. pictures are a little smaller than we expected, kind of a bit smaller than traditional baseball cards. but great!
I couldn't give it a 5 star for a simple reason.I still can't figure out the perfect lighting for perfect occasion.But overall, it's very easy to use and SO CUTE to carry around.It's a good size and weight.Definitely recommend it especially at this price.
This camera was exactly what I wanted. The size is a little smaller than what a "Polaroid" would be but as stated, the size was exactly what I wanted.
It's a great camera. Fun, easy to use and takes good pics! Plus it's pink and it's perfect for a teen!
Good product.... Good transaction....overall good experience... Would definitely shop with Amazon again especially when the holidays are drawing near !
I bought three of the Instax Minis for a family Christmas gift -- a family scavenger hunt around our city.  They are cute, and a fun gimmick.  Because I bought three, with the scavenger hunt in mind, I wasn't concerned about the size of the prints; however, the prints are small (the size of a credit card, as someone else posted).  These cameras are a great, fun way to share a few smiles and laughs at parties.
This camera it's absolutely amazing, incredible photos, everyone ask us where we bought it !, incredible delivery, I definitely recommend buying this! Everyone enjoys it and luv intax pics it's TOTALLY FETCH!!!! ILUV IT 😉
My daughter loves this and although it took a few more days to get it, it was worth it.  She loves retro and it takes really awesome small instant pictures. Easy to use, instant gratification
Would have loved the pink but daughter was very happy, this is a fun item but, film can get pricey! Should come with at least one pack of film!
These are adorable, fun and they take great photos (well... they take great instant photos which are traditionally very very poor)When my daughter started asking for one of these for Christmas I was pretty annoyed since she already owns a Canon PowerShot G series and she uses my Digital SLR. I could not understand why anyone would want an instant camera which costs approximately $1 per photo and takes awful pictures.However - This deal on Amazon makes it acceptable (if still sort of pointless) in that you can buy 2 rolls of 10 pictures for $13 and the camera at a steal.Compared to digital this is a joke and a toy - but compared to finding a decent Polaroid and paying for THAT film, this is quite frugal and fun.
The camera brought a lot of joy to our 7 year old at Christmas as her very first camera. Thanks
While I would love to say it worked out well, aside from it being a pink camera, (her favorite color), it's a little foreign to present this to our 5 year old, in hopes that "instant gratification of a printed picture and watching it develop before her eyes" would have won her over, with the age of digital cameras and photographs. Maybe in a year or so, she will have more patience to wait to capture a moment, and enjoy the printed picture, or sharing it with friends. That is our hope! We did get a couple of good pictures, but we had to walk her through the process and we definitely wasted several pictures in the interim. With only 10 per roll, timing and patience are key.
Clicked a picture and it didn't work. Really excited to buy it because it was a gift for a friend but sadly, it didn't work.
The camera is sturdy and easy to use. My eight year old daughter had a blast with it. Maybe too good a time; she went through 40 exposures in one day!Be warned, the film is very pricey so this is not a camera for everyday use.
After doing some research, Amazon is the cheapest, most convenient way to buy the Instax Mini 8 online. A trip to Urbanscape would burn u an extra 40usd plus for the same thing.
I like this camera a lot! I have taken great pictures on it. However the dial that adjusts the settings doesn't seem to work :( I twist it and it stays on the outdoor setting.
Love this reminds me of my school days with the old Polaroid. The pictures are DL size but so vintage and camera is good quality too and great price.
I bought this instant camera for my ten year old daughter and she loves it! Here is her review on it:  Its fairly easy to start and I love how this camera is small and modern but at the same time you get the old school feeling as well. When I took My first picture I was surprised that it came out white but my Mom and dad both laughed and told me that I had to wait for it to dry before I could see actual colors! The day that I got the camera was also my dads birthday so when we went out to dinner I took at least 8 pictures! Thanks Mom!
This is exactly what she wanted, in the style and color she requested. She was using it within minutes of opening the package.
I bought it for my girlfriend and I had the mini7 and this one is so much better,  its thinner and has more features.  Good product
good looking does the job granddaughter happy too soon to give more details but over haul great camera. waiting for first set of pictures
Bought this for our 12 yr. old granddaughter for her family's mission trip to Haiti, where they helped with a Vacation Bible School.  She loved it - and it filled the purpose for her of taking lots of pixs of the children.  A neat side note, she gave away the pixs to the kids, many whom had never seen a pixture of themselves!  I bought the 100 pix pack so she was even able to take photos as souviners for the family.  The photos are small but that was okay. It's an easy-to-use camera, which was the whole point of buying it for a young girl. I purchased the camera bag as well, which she told me was very handy and kept it clean. Since arriving back home, I ordered for film for her to use with her friends. I consider it a real good buy, especially for the original purpose!
I love it, its perfect! The only dissappointment is how expensive the film is. :/ The pictures I have taken are really great so far! :)
I love this camera!  In the digital age all my pics end up stored on sd cards or computer files or on facebook and it can be a time cosuming project to sort and print these.  This camera is really fun and takes great (however small) pictures.  My kids loved the novelty of it.
This was a Christmas gift and well worth the money!  The picture is clear and you can capture the moment and have the picture right there as it happens.  The only thing that would make this product better, would be including a small package of film.  I thought that it came with a small package of film and luckily I took the camera out for inspection.  That was my fault, however, it would have been nice.  :)
This polaroid camera takes good pictures under the right lighting.  It isn't something you would want to rely on for those "have to capture" moments.  But it is a solid and simple throwback to a time where polaroids were our only affordable option.  The size of the picture is smaller than the old-style polaroid.  Approximately 2 x 3.  It was a gift for my pre-teen daughter and she LOVES it.
i've been wanting this camera how a long time and i found the price to be very reasonable. this camera is super super cute and fun to use! i brought it to school and all my friends wanted to take pictures and they kept saying how cute it was!everything about this camera is cute. but something that i really wanted to know when buying this was if it came with film or not. IT DOES NOT COME WITH FILM. you do not know how many times i've looked for this answer to this "question". BUY FILM. luckily i did buy film.it takes small pictures but the pictures are cute.
We bought this camera for our teenage daughter for Christmas and it's one of her favorite presents!  She took it to a sleepover recently and it was a huge hit with her friends, too!  The pictures are tiny and cute and mostly clear in sunny conditions.  She LOVES getting the picture right away to pass out to her friends and it's super easy to set up and use.  A+ gift for a teenager!!!
My 10 year old daughter loves this camera. It was her favorite Christmas gift. Easy to use and good picture quality.
Did not want to get my girl some technology just because everyone else was getting it--expensive and we are not ready to start patrolling her internet exposure. Instant photos are fun and the hit of every party. She loves it.
This camera is so cute!  And it works well.  The pictures are clear but still appear retro grainy - which makes it even more fun!  The camera is slippery though so I bought the case made for the camera - you can leave the bottom portion of the case on the camera and still take pictures - which makes it easier to handle!
i love it!! i have been taking so many pictures ever since i got it and its great. definatly get this camera!
Had a lot of good and surprise comments about Polaroid.  Good camera for my daubDaughter to fool around with cuzzins.
This is a good product for the money. I took a picture of a lighted christmas tree indoor and the photo was more white shaded with the flash on. But its is ok. the camera serves my purpose.
we will not use it for the important things, but will have a lot of fun using it for parties and my 13 year old daughter will use if often with her friends.  It works great!
Love love love this!  It was my 9 year old daughters favorite gift!!  All her friends want one now. I think it will encourage her to be a better photographer because she won't just take endless digital pictures
Great little 'Polaroid'. We had fun taking photos of children at an event and then giving them the photos immediately allowing them to watch the photo develop. The children were amazed as they had never seen a Polaroid type photo before.
Best gift ever! According to my 16 year old granddaughter !  Thank you, now I need a lot more film
I have a spouse that loves cameras and pictures. The camera itself is built well. The pictures are fun since they are instant. The camera takes good pictures in various light conditions to include low lighting. If your a photo person or happen to be married to one, you will want to get this camera.
What you see in the viewfinder is not exactly what you get in the picture.  My wife blew through 2 boxes of expensive film trying to take a picture of a Christmas card she made.  The first pic of the kids in a large room was OK for a Polaroid type of picture so we thought the item was defective.  Come to find out it's either design flaw or just don't work for smaller close ups.  The old Polaroid's viewfinder was in the center right in the middle over the lens, so what you see is what it shot.  But this one has the viewfinder on the side.  So close up shots of smaller things appeared off center.  My wife and I also thought the quality wasn't on par with the old Polaroid snapshots either.  Returning this item.
Searched for a better price and Amazon, of course, came through as the best. This camera was bought as a gift. My son loves it. The hardest part was finding film. Amazon had that as well. A lot nicer than conventional Polaroid. Takes nice pictures.
love my fujifilm instax mini 8 very easy to use buying the big bundle of the film is better it saves you plenty of money.
I gave this to my eight year old and I think I might get one for myself. It is so fun, the kids all love it. We use it to put pictures in their journals. Totally recommend
ORDERED FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER.  IT ARRIVED JUST AS EXPECTED.  SHE WAS THRILLED WITH IT.  WOULD ORDER AGAIN WITHOUT A PROBLEM.
Got this for my granddaughter and she loves, loves, loves it!!!  The pictures turn out clear and sharp.  Just too cute!!!!!
Help my friend to buy one. I don't open it but looks nice. Very cute and beautiful.It fits girls.
My 16-year old wanted an instant camera but didn't know which brand to get.  After reviewing feedback from others on Amazon, I decided to purchase the Instax Mini 8 instant film camera.  I don't regret it.  My daughter is happy with it, with the quality of the pictures, and ease of use.  It is definitely a straight-forward camera to use.  Glad we went with the Fujifilm instax mini 8!
This was a Christmas gift for our 13 yr old granddaughter.  She loves it.  The pictures are decent and camera is easy to operate.
I purchased this camera for our 6-year old granddaughter because it would enable her to take pictures and see the outcomes quickly. The fact that it was available in her favorite color contributed to my decision. She opened the box under the Christmas tree and absolutely loved it.  As it is easy to operate, she immediately took a couple of pictures.  Her excitement at seeing the people in the pictures shortly after was infectious. Everyone wanted to look at the pictures and try the camera.  She hung onto the snapshots still the next day when waving us good bye from the car. She said, 'How did Santa know that that is exactly what I wanted?" I gave it a rating of four because the pictures are good but do not expect top notch quality. I recommend this camera to anyone who likes to see pictures rather than store them in cyberspace. Can you imagine its usefulness at a children's birthday party?  The hostess may take pic of everyone invited with the B-day baby and give it to them as a souvenir. Handy and fun sums up this camera!
she likes it and that's all. Though at first we need to figure out how to use it. Happy New Year
This was a gift for my 15 yr old daughter. She loves it and it is easy to use.The only downside is the expensive film that is only available online.
I bought this product over a month ago .It was going to be a christmas present for my daughter,not only havent i received it yet, they say it will be mid-January before i get it. stay away from this company,not worth it!!!! Disgrace!!!!
Great camera for kids 9+ years. They get a kick out of the pictures developing in an instant. Camera came in quick....
We bought this for Christmas and how disappointed to find that the camera wouldn't function -even after 4 people reading instructions - it wouldn't shoot
I have loved instant cameras all my life and I am glad I chose this one. It is not for everyday use but perfect for documenting all of my holiday events and it amazed everyone who saw me us it. Love the nostalgia.
easy to set up & use, pictures came out clear, bought for kids and they love the novelty of it! Just have to remind them there's only 10 photo's per film as they're used to taking numerous ones with their digital.
I have nothing bad to say about this camera...and neither do any of the other people who see it.  It's just such a cute, cool, retro item to have.
Arrived on time. Meets the description. Happy with  the product, no complaints whatsoever. Bought it as a gift for my little sister, she loves it.
This is awesome camera, takes great pictures, easy to use, simple settings, and it is just plain fun to use.
This camera takes sweet little instant pics. This camera feels good to. It doesnt feel like a cheap item. Its got a little weight and feels well made. Highly recommend for teens and scrap/smash bookers.
bought this for my teenage daughter and she absolutely loves it.  A great buy.  Thinking about buying one for my mom.
I like it. It takes the best pictures and it's really cute. The pictures have a really good quality and design
the Fiji instax is so adorable and perfect to capture memories. Although its not the best quality it was exactly what I was looking for I take it everywhere. Something that I want forever
Great little camera got it for my daughter who's 10 she loved it..film not to bad priced through amazon ...
This was by far by 9 year old daughter's favorite Christmas gift. She loves getting instant pictures. And it's easy to use!
Purchased this for my 5 year old for Christmas. She is able to handle the camera on her own and was instantly able to turn it on and snap away!  Love the color and ease of this product!
Bought this camera for my daughter and although the pics are not high def. they are cute and perfect! Would recommend for any teen!!
My granddaughter, age 8, loves this camera I got her for Christmas.  I also got the clear camera case to protect it.  Only down side is they did not include film with it but luckily I bought some for extra so she was able to take pictures as soon as we had it together for her.  Highly recommend for grade school age children anyway.
perfect! paid a little more than in the stores, but worth it as it was in stock and arrived on time!!
It's good in some cases but not that good qualitywell i guess you get what you paid foralso, my light keeps blinking in the wrong settingI guess ill tell square trade ...since i have one
So easy to operate.  Takes great clear pictures.  Everyone loved it at the Christmas party.  It was a big hit.Everything old becomes new again.
Granddaughter just loved the instant gratification this camera gives....took her a little while to get on to how close she needed to be to get a good pic. Used the twin-paks of film already!
I absolutely LOVE this camera! I have a Polaroid Sun 660 but they stopped making film for it, and it's super expensive from other sellers. The Instax Mini 8 is both cute and portable, and the film is pretty cheap: 20 photos for ~$13. Can't beat it.The only problem I have is that night photos are awful and rarely develop. Make sure you're in at least semi-good lighting because the little flash on the camera won't do much good in darker settings.
Bought this as a gift for my young adult daughter who is into photography.  Her first comment was that it seemed a little cheaply made, but she's use to the quality, weight and feel of a high-end Canon.  It works very well and seem simple to use.
I love this camera its perfect and really fun! I take it everywhere with me! Im a bit couscous about what i take pictures of because the film is kind of pricey. But other than that, it works well and the pictures turn out great and full of color!
The camera is easy to use but came with no film to start off with. I didn't order a box of film and my granddaughter was very disappointed she couldn't take any pictures. It would have been an extremelycourteous gesture to have included a small role of film.
My daughter loves it and it produced quality pictures. They are small pics but she likes it. Easy to use also.
We bought this for a picture guest book for our wedding. The wedding was in the evening and the pictures were a little darker than we would like. You have to get really close to see the faces and some things around them.The camera is actually easy to use. Just the quality of the pictures that we were a little disappointed with.The camera came in as expected, no problems or anything.
It is good， I like it. And the color is also beautiful. It is real a good thing. Thank you.
It is a nice product, easy to setup and use, picture clarity also pretty good. Really handy for instant pictures
Product exceeded my expectations and I would recommend this item to all my family and friends! Great quality and awesome customer service.
I would recommend this camera to anyone that doesn't mind spending money on film. I love this camera. I do wish, however, that there were a way I could turn the flash off. Other than that, 5/5 star rating.
i like it !!it is so good for me to take photo! i like this price ~~ it is good!
I love this camera and sometimes retro is better. You have to be careful with the type of lighting that you have and it doesn't really come with directions about the setting but other than that no complaints. Plus the color is cute and its light enough to slip in your purse
Love this camera! So fun and takes cute little pictures. It's fun to watch the pictures develop right in front of you. Takes pretty decent pictures too. Very easy to use. Definitely would recommend.
I got this camera for my daughter's 10th birthday, and we both love it. It's very easy to figure out and use. The only thing we had to look at the instructions for was the direction to load the film. Everything on it works perfectly.
awesome little polaroid you can take on the go. The picture comes out really nice and the fixed focus makes things much easier. Unfortunately the film is quite expensive, so make sure you know what you're getting yourself into when you invest into these things!
Great color, Great price, Great Quality. The Camera prints instant photos you can hold and share. Great way for cheap reliable photos.
Exactly what I wanted. Fun and easy to use. Big but I like that it stands out. Film is easy to find. Price was way cheaper on amazon than any store. Love it love it love it
Although it took me a while to figure out the brightness settings when taking indoor pictures, I really have enjoyed having the ability to have them printed out instantly. It is not a high quality camera, but one worth having if you are looking to decorate your space with unique photographs.
This camera is spectacular. It's a bit big but I lOVE it and the way it takes pictures especially how the film is wallet sized.  They are too cute
I bought this as a present after lots of research, and I couldn't be happier! I'm not familiar with polaroid or fujifilm instax cameras, but I am very happy that I got the Instax Mini 8. The pictures turn out WAY better than I expected, making very unique mementos. Images were clear, flash isn't too bright, and believe it or not, we actually managed to take a very nice "selfie!" Don't worry if you can't read Japanese -- putting the film and batteries into the camera was very straightforward and easy. Can't wait to take this to future events with friends and family!
The mini 8 is really cute and easy to use. I love the color of light mint. The price is also comparatively good.
Great fun for my 5-year-old twins.  They can take pictures themselves and unlike pictures taken on the phone they can keep the photos.
I really love this camera! It is fairly small, it's easy to take selfies or pictures with another person. The quality of the picture really depends on your lighting. The automatic light detection feature is pretty nice. It doesn't always work perfectly, but there's only really been 1 out of about 15 pictures that i've taken that hasn't come out good because of it. The only complaint is that the pictures are fairly small, but that's kind of the point.
This one is really good, i bought this for taking pictures for my baby. it is useful. it is worth  this money.
really love this cute one, the color is bright and fresh, really fashionable, brought me so much fun, recommend this to people who have this affection.
Came on time, I super love it. And the packaging was goood too. I really love the pink. I do wish they provided at least a film or two. Good thing my film came in first so do order films
Great little camera. Durable and easy to use. GF and kids love it. I hate that the pink colour was the cheapest however. Would have liked to gotten in black, but I'm not paying $10 more just for different colour.
Remember polaroids?  This camera is the technological successor to the bygone instant camera.  It's a little fancier around the edges than an old school polariod, but the pictures comes out on tiny little business card shaped film.  Adorable for a novelty, but not really for any sort of serious photography.
Kids, you will be the first on your street with this.  If you love tiny pictures in your wallet, this is for you.It's a trip to 1955.
fun to use and less expensive than the polariod models, love the color choices for this camera, easy to operate...just plain fun to use
I LOVE this camera. Its so cute and fun. My only negative is that where you look through is small and a bit awkward. But my kids love it when I take pictures of them with this camera.
Very cute camera and easy to use! I love the color too! I brought it to a party and had a good time!
So much fun.  I already have one and this was a gift for a teenager so she can chronicle her life.  Love the instant film, though it's expensive!
This takes amazing pictures. We are using it for a birthday party.  Each girl will make a scrapbook page for the birthday girl for her to keep.
One of the best purchases I've ever made on Amazon. I adore this camera. It's simple to use and pictures "develop" within minutes. I've always wanted an instant camera, and I'm so glad I picked this one!
I love this camera so much! I bring it with me almost everywhere, although it takes some space in my bag and can get a little heavy, I'm ready at any moment to capture a event to put on my wall. Very easy to use and I absolutly recommend to anyone! The pictures are kinda small but hey, you get what you pay for. And the picture quality is surprisingly good. All in all I love this camera!Also it's a great conversation piece.
My sister loves this. It takes really cool pictures. I wish the pics were slightly larger...but she absolutely loves it...and they are quite cute when they develop
Absolutely the greatest little camera ever! I purchased this camera specifically to take on vacation with me, and I do not regret it one bit. Easy to carry, easy to use. I have recommended it to several friends already.
I bought this camera for my daughter she wanted it as a birthday gift. It turns out the whole family loves it the pictures are really good.
This Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 is worth buying!Very affordable.Comes with a pack of batteries (two AA) and a pink wrist strap.Film needs to be bought separate but the quality of your photos are great! The camera comes with photo settings on the dial.The photo is ready quickly and the photo is the size of a credit card.This pink is the perfect shade.
this is good Camera i purchase form the amazon, the picture come out showing very class and nice, also small camera easy to carry, don't need to spend a lot of money to get a good camera. good Quality make not easy to break.
i love it! so cute and beautiful camera. the only one point i dont like it is the light can not be close alone.
I absolutely love this camera! Great for parties!!! Very fun camera! Only draw back is if you take a pic outside when its sunny, the pic looks washed out...other than that, I highly recommend!!!
Super cute! Whenever I bring it out my friends all want a picture. Plus I inspired several other friends to buy their own! The pics are tiny but cute. Two people will fit in a frame perfectly, anymore than that and the flash spreads out too far and you can't see everyone. I use it just to capture moments of me and my friends. The film is expensive, so buy it in bulk and use it wisely. The camera fits in my purse and isn't super heavy but you will notice it in a bag.
I bought it as a gift for my girl friend and she loves it. It's really easy and fun to use.
Made my husband so happy with this. He has such fun w/the kids and their friends.  Imagine taking photos the old fashioned way and still getting  a kick out of it.  Takes good shots.
i have been using it when i went out with my friends. it really convenient to carry out and memory the moments with them.
it so cute and it work well!!!! Both my best friend and I got one. it is the camera i'm looking for
I would consider this camera one of my best purchases of all time. I am totally in love with every photo that I take with it. It's very easy to operate and absolutely worth it. I try to use it as often as I can! ♥
fun camera but the pictures come out looking blurry/ out of focus. the color looks faded and pics look old
Love this camera So cute and so much fun to play with. I love how the photos have turned out
This camera is light, fun and SUPER easy to use. Make sure you have good batteries (they come with) or else you'll be a little confused as to why the camera won't turn on or load film. It was almost too easy that I overlooked the simplicity and had a little trouble…oops! Anyway, it's fun. I bought it for a guest book and it takes decent pictures and it's very easy to use. It's much larger than it seems online-which I'm very happy with. I recommend it for fun! If you want professional looking photos, this isn't for you.
The cutest instant camera out there! I love the flash settings, and film is easy to find. Lightweight and easy to take along.
I sent it as a gift so that I did not play it at all. But I love the color and my friends like it. That is wonderful.
Love it! Cute and easy to use plus the size is not that big it makes it easy to carry around.
perfect discount! Also, the color is perfect! Though the price of the camera is not expensive, the instant film is so expensiveTOT
LOVE IT!!!! I adore this camera, the pictures are great, the price is affordable (both the camera and the instant films) and it captures wonderful memories of a credit card size. Everybody loves my new camera :)
Nice gadget. I love it. Especially my girl friend likes the pink appearance. Very fit for entertainment. Cool to see a picture coming into force.
My daughter (11) loved it! Now my son and other daughter want one too. The film can get spendy, but it is worth it. I love it because they can take a picture and put it in their junk journal, write about it, and have memories to look back on. Great buy, and it looks like I'm buying 2 more for Christmas!
It's so pretty and not scratched! Love the pastel pink and would definitely recommend it :) Its worth its price and easy to use :D
Easy to use and awesome! The color is softer than shown on the screen. Overall it's great! I love it so much.
LOVE THIS LIL THING. WORTH EVERY PENNY. RECOMMENDED SELLER!! FAST SHIPMENT, GREAT PRICE. GREAT FOR ANY OCCASION, GET TO CAPTURE DOWN EVERY MEMORABLE MOMENT.
It was delivered promptly and it is exactly has pictured.Will be a great Christmas gift.  I would recommend to anyone.
This is a cute camera. Only thing is if it's too bright outside your photo may come out white like a blank polaroid. So of course I wasted a few shots because of the sunlight. It's a bit hard to tell what settings work best but definitely play around the camera. Very light & easy to carry. Love using it!!!
i ordered it right before traveling abroad. It was fine. Still trying to figure out the light setting, sometimes it's too dark, other times it's bright and pretty. That's probably my lack of knowledge. Otherwise it's a fun piece to have. pretty light.
It is pretty good, have lots of mode and easy to take.but the price is almost the same as walmart.
I always want a instant film camera and decided to get this until I see the yellow one. It's just so adorable and fancy that I have to buy it. And it's not too expensive!
there is small black point on the picture. For every picture. It waste me about 2 pack. Can u give me a answer? Its problem from camera or sheet.
This camera is amazing not only is it cute it takes great pictures. It's a great conversation starter.  I have gotten plenty of complements. You cannot turn  the flash of but that's okay.  The shopping was really fast that was good.
Bought this as a gift for my daughter, she loves it!!!!  Makes me want to get my old Polaroid out, except cant find the film anywhere, and it doesn't work!!!  Great gift for late teens early adults!
Guys, this camera is definitely a great gift for your girlfriend!!!Not too expensive, good quality, cute color.five stars!
All her friends now want to buy one! Great little instant camera and fun and very compact. Early teachings of photography!
I love to create mini albums for when I go on trips, this allows me to have an instant picture and journal in realtime. Next adventure China in 2 weeks!
amazing camera. has 4 settings AND  a auto light sensor. small and easy to carry around. very great item. easy to use
I bought this camera for my teenage daughter! She loves it! I love the fact that it brings back great memories of the polaroid and when people used to place pictures in an actual photo album!
I absolutely love this little baby of a camera. I was torn on the colors between pink, white or yellow. I was hesitant to go for the yellow, fearing it would be too bright and not subtle. I was very happy to find out that its a really soft canary yellow - its easy on the eyes! The camera is a little bigger than your palm and it does have an interesting (weird) shape, but I see it more of a toy than anything else so I don't mind. It's not meant for practicality, its meant for fun! This is a great instant camera to have and I would recommend it to anyone. The pictures it produces are really sharp and clear!
I did not realize how handy this little camera would be.  It is so much fun for a party to take and print the pictures immediately.
I recently bought this camera and took it to New York. It is so cute, fun and small enough to fit in my hand and in my purse. It takes clear pictures and is so fun for vacations. I recommend buying film from amazon, its the cheapest
I loved it I'm glad I bought this. I take it with me everywhere. Everyone's loves it too they want one
Great product, came right on time! I can buy the film right down the street which is amazing..Get to play with it a little to get adjusted to the settings. I love my new toy!
What a fun party accessory!Easy to use for everyonepictures are small but funseems durableI think all ages can use it
I got this is a gift for my girlfriend and her one criticism is that you cannot control the flash which has a tendency to wash some photos out even when you are outside. The only solution is to cover it with your hand or a piece of electrical tape which is a minor work around. But this is a straight up polaroid camera so people expecting to get high quality photos should just go digital. This is a nostalgic type camera good for having fun with. Great for portraits and taking to parties and whatnot with friends because the film is about the size of a business card. People LOVE polaroids and this is a good solid camera. Feels like a fisher price toy in the hands but is ultimately solid. Film can be expensive at about .75-$1 per sheet so be prepared for that.
I had been eyeing this camera for awhile, but just couldn't bring myself to buy it. I already own the Instax Wide camera, which is great, but I got tired of how much space it was taking up in my bag every time I brought it along. I had received an amazon gift card from my bosses and had an upcoming anniversary trip so I finally took the step and purchased this camera. It's very simple to use, even if you're a complete novice and comes in such cute colors. It's small, so it doesn't take up much space in your bag, and fits comfortably in your hand. The film isn't a bad price, either, and it's actually cheaper than the Polaroid film I used to be in my golden age of polaroid use (90s/early 2000s). The quality is much better than I expected, being so small. Very crisp and clear, as most fujifilms are.
Great camera! Fun and cute.  Not sure why people complain about the size and quality.  It's not a camera to use for taking great shots.  Yes, the photos are small and not great quality but they are fun and artsy when you put them in an album and stuff.  I hope it lasts a long time.
This was a great alternative to the Polaroid camera.  The film was cheaper and everyone loved it at the party.
Super fun and really easy to use. I like how it has settings for indoor/outdoor and sunny/cloudy. The pictures come out nice. Not the greatest quality, but it's sole purpose isn't for anything professional. It's a nice camera to have for social gatherings and such.
Great camera to use for our guestbook at our wedding.  It was very easy to use.  Everyone had a great time using it and loved the way they looked in the film.
Bought this as a gift for my 14 year old niece and she loves it! She had it out of the box, loaded with film and was taking pictures in just 10 minutes. It is easy to use, but her only complaint was that it is kind of hard to handle due to the size/bulkiness and layout of the buttons. The picture quality could be better, I suppose, but just like Polaroids, the look of the image is part of what is fun about it. We'll have to wait to see how she likes after more use, but overall I am happy with this purchase.
This is such a fun little camera that even has some cool and unexpected high tech features! Recommended to all my friends.
The shipping was pretty slow. I had waited for almost 2 weeks but other than that everything is GREAT! The camera looks so cute in pink and comes in a good size. I would recomend other ppl to get one !
Really great for taking random photos and getting that throwback instant film feel. I really love it, great camera, very portable and if you buy the zippered camera case for it, you are good to go.
THE ONLY THING IS THAT THE FILM IS QUITE EXPENSIVE , THE PICTURES ARE NOT AS NIT AS I THOUGH THEY WERE GOING TO BE
Item was received sooner than expected. This camera was a gift. It is the perfect color and style. Customer is pleased with quality of merchandise.
I am not really good at use this camera, but I am trying to use it. White is really cute.
We are using this at a church for pictures of people at functions that they can take home instead of printing and mailing.  Downfall is they are small.
My son asked for this camera for his 14th birthday. I was sort of apprehensive about buying it after reading some of the reviews that talked about the small picture size and clarity. I also wondered how much money we would end up spending on film because of his desire to take pictures of EVERYTHING. His cell phone already has a camera, so why have another camera to carry around that will produce pictures that will ultimately lay around the house or end up in a drawer? After all of my doubts, this turned out to be a great gift. My son is very selective about what he shoots and the pictures are no smaller than expected. There hasn't been a problem with the clarity of the pictures that wasn't a result of user error. The kids all love it! It's pretty interesting to see them shooting pictures with an instant camera again.
This little camera is great! Smaller than I thought which makes it all the more portable. Perfect way to capture the moment. Recommended.
OMG i love this, it's so much fun to use and make wonderful memories with love ones. Plus i can fit it in my purse so easily
Works and looks great! Glad I came across this, I would recommend it to others! Amazon always follows threw for me
I freakin very like itI will give five star for this productIt was a very cool mini camera
I'm a first timer here at amazon and i took the chance to order this camera cause i've ben wanting this and finally i have something to call my own.. im super in love with it.. well not just me but my boyfriend and the family :) i actually got super excited when i got them with the film.. I know film is kinda pricey but its worth it! I just use mines for special occasion or to take a picture for the kids, even them they liked.. i don't see any problem with it so far..
I loved this camera! It is so compact and adorable. I loved the flash settings on this! The photos were what you would expect from an instant camera.
this color is very beautiful. my bff bought a pink one. it's also really pretty.and it works good. i love it!!
I really like the color its soft yellow. The camera is super cute. Very happy w me purchase. It take great pictures.
Hazel loves it !!!!Bought this for my girlfriend and she cant stop taking picures....It was such a good deal too
This camera is super cute!! and you really get what you paid for. The pictures come out in the cutest business card size photos that you can literally put them anywhere (like inside a wallet!)I think the only issue that I have is that you can't really take pictures in really sunny areas because the photo won't come out great but that's expected with this type of camera.Also you go through film real easy! so stock up!
Great camera very handy lovely blue color and great features for shooting indoor and outdoor A must have love it!
this camera is great. it works pretty good. i would not recomend this camera for professional use. it has one small problem.since the viewing glass and the camera are not on top of each other when you take the picture you have to  kinda slant the view of whatever tour taking this picture of to the right. if not the picture wont come out how you want itto. but other then that small glitch the camera is amazing.
My new addiction! I LOVE this camera. It makes taking pictures so special and memorable. If you're not into photography, you will be. The quality is amazing and the camera is too cute!
Just received my instax 8 in the mail today. Came to me earlier than expected and I'm so happy. I can't stop taking photos! It's a bummer that film is so expensive but it's so worth it. The package was in great condition. I highly recommend this product.
It's definitely a fun camera, the pictures look so cool and has a nostalgic feeling to it. It's a shame the prints are a bit small.
Uhm. I love it but I Wish it came with sample film. Cuz now I need to buy some -.-
I have always wanted one ! I am having so much fun using it :) greatly recommended for those who likes taking pictures :)
i just love this. although i wish the film was cheaper, i generally like taking pics but i love how i can have my pics instantly!!! every where i go, i would take it with me and i call it my baby haha but seriously i love it so much
I am very happy with this camera! I'm looking foward to having it to make memories with on my wedding day!
Really like camera so far. Ordered it for an 80s party. Wanted that polaroid type fill and the camera delivered.
Its so much fun to use and fits in a little purse so you can bring it anywhere & it's everything I expected it to be. Is just a little tricky choosing the correct light setting for the perfect picture, so some of my first pictures came out a little dark, but other than that I loved it!
This is so much fun to have, and i am very happy with my purchase! I cant wait to take it on trips with me and i love using it when i go out with my friends!. I wish the Polaroid film was less expensive but that is the only downfall! But overall this is a fun film camera!
I began taking pictures with my roommate as soon as I received it! It is easy to use and the effect is quite good, better than I expected.
it broke and now i cant use it! i was so excited but the films stopped developing whenever i try to tak a picture.now it comes out blank other than that its the cutest camera EVER
Bought it for my Best friend as a birthday gift! Looks great! She loves it! Althought it's kind of expensive
This camera is the cutest thing ever! The pictures come out wonderful and are the perfect size. I highly recommend buying this camera! Not only is it adorable but it is easy to use and the pictures are great quality as well. The only draw back is that the film costs quite a lot of money but you can usually find pretty good deals here on amazon. I was deciding whether to "invest" in this camera and i am so happy i persuaded myself into buying it.
Love this camera!!!! It takes amazing pics in all types of lighting! The size of the photos are perfect and the resolution is crystal clear!! All of my friends were so jealous! Now they all want one too :)
I love it . The Pink one is so great, so I bought this again for my friend's birthday too!
I seriously love this camera so freaking much! I don't get to use it much since the film is so expensive but it's still worth it...at least to me. I don't know how other people will feel considering you can't take as many pictures as you would on a digital camera.
This camera was on my granddaughter's wish list. She loves it and the business card size photos are a lot of fun for all of us.
I'd been wanting an instant camera for a while now, and this was just so perfectly pink. The delivery was nice and speedy (though I wasn't in town to get it!) and everything was all in order. That was when I realized I'd forgotten to buy film, but that wasn't so bad. All in all, it fits great in my purse and it has all those quick adjustment flashes for indoor/outdoor transitions. Muy bueno!
This is the worst experience I had with Amazon. I will never buy stuff from this provider.The website of the product said close-up lens is included, while in fact I only receive camera itself.I called customer service. The guy on the phone was very rude and insisted the close-up lens is built-in, which it is not!He even hanged up my phone.This is just a terrible experience..
It is cheaper than many film camera.The photos that took were nice.That's so good! It's cheaper than that in China.
I gave 4 stars, because one of my instax came black on a cloudy day, even though I used that function...so, unless you are taking pictures on a really really cloudy day, use the normal function, that should work.It's a great present for everybody and I'm really happy with my purchase, I would recommend this to any pro or amateur photographer
My daughter loved this camera. Gave it to her for her 9th day. It was a hit with kids & grown ups alike.....very nostalgic of the Polaroid my grandmother had.
I love the camera! The photo quality is awesome too! And its in my favorite color! And you can put the pictures in your wallet!
First off, I want to say that this is absolutely the cutest camera I have ever seen.  It takes such adorable photos and is very easy to use.  It is larger than I anticipated, but is nothing enormous. I'll be honest, I was/am a bit nervous when I first received it as it is made mostly out of plastic.  I am used to the metal frame of an SLR camera, so the light weight and more fragile exterior is just something I will have to get used to!  Other than that, it was pretty simple putting the whole thing together and the only set up it needed was to put in two AA batteries (comes included.)I'll be honest, I had a hard time figuring out the lighting settings.  I am probably one of the few with this issue as it seems a lot more straightforward than I was expecting.  This camera comes with around 6 light settings.  A light would illuminate one of the settings (they are located above the lens) but I couldn't tell why or when it was changing.  The instructions have a sentence description of the setting so I felt like it didn't explain enough.  But after trial and error I realized that the light indicates the recommended light setting depending on the environment.  So as you move your camera around, the light may change and all you have to do is move the it until it is set where it is illuminated.
Cute camera. Easy to use!It's light and easy to carry around, I would suggest buying the black caseDefinitely recommend it to people who are looking for a polaroid camera.
